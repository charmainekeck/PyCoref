 BAYERISCHE MOTOREN WERKE AG, or <COREF ID="1">BMW</COREF>, said parent-company sales rose 17% in 1987's first 10 months, to 14.4 billion West German marks ($8.66 billion) from 12.3 billion marks a year earlier. 
 <COREF ID="2">The auto maker</COREF> didn't disclose consolidated sales or earnings but predicted a rise in group sales to about 19 billion marks in <COREF ID="3">1987</COREF> from 17.52 billion marks in <COREF ID="4">1986</COREF>. 


 Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed the long-term debt of DEN NORSKE CREDITBANK under review for possible downgrading, following <COREF ID="6">the bank</COREF>'s announcement last Friday that <COREF ID="7">it</COREF> may have incurred trading losses of more than 600 million Norwegian kroner ($94.3 million) over the past month -- enough to wipe out <COREF ID="8">1987</COREF> net income -- partly through unauthorized dealing by an individual broker in <COREF ID="9">the bank</COREF>'s own portfolio. 
 <COREF ID="10">Moody's</COREF>, which currently rates the long-term debt of Norway's largest bank double-A-3, said <COREF ID="13">about $1.2 billion of debt</COREF> is affected by <COREF ID="15">the review</COREF>. 


 DEUTSCHE GENOSSENSCHAFTS BANK said <COREF ID="16">it</COREF> intends to acquire a majority stake in the trade union-owned insurance group VOLKSFUERSORGE through an insurance concern it controls. 
 The combination of <COREF ID="20">Volksfuersorge</COREF> and <COREF ID="21">the insurance group R@amp;V ALLGEMEINE VERSICHERUNGS AG</COREF> would form West Germany's second-largest retail-insurance concern. 
 A spokesman for the trade-union holding company said <COREF ID="24">it</COREF> is likely to sell slightly more than 50% of <COREF ID="25">Volksfuersorge</COREF>. 


 LINDE AG said that <COREF ID="26">group sales</COREF> fell 6.7% in <COREF ID="27">1987</COREF>'s first nine months, to 2.56 billion West German marks ($1.54 billion) from 2.73 billion marks <COREF ID="28">a year earlier</COREF>, but that <COREF ID="29">1987</COREF> sales are expected to rise as much as 9% as the result of several large orders booked in the fourth quarter. 
 <COREF ID="30">The machinery maker</COREF>'s earnings <COREF ID="31">this year</COREF> are likely to be "wholly satisfactory," Chairman Hans Meinhardt said. 
 Analysts expect domestic group profit to rise from <COREF ID="32">last year</COREF>'s 106 million marks ($63.7 million). 


 NATIONALE NEDERLANDEN N.V. said <COREF ID="33">it</COREF> expects to reach a definitive agreement "within the next few weeks" to sell MIDWESTERN UNITED LIFE INSURANCE CO., one of its U.S. subsidiaries, to Ireland's largest insurer, <COREF ID="36">IRISH LIFE PLC. </COREF>
 <COREF ID="37">The Netherlands' biggest insurance group</COREF> said that <COREF ID="38">Midwestern United</COREF> duplicated the operations of one of <COREF ID="39">its</COREF> other U.S. units and that <COREF ID="41">the Dutch concern</COREF> hasn't changed <COREF ID="42">its</COREF> strategy of increasing <COREF ID="43">its</COREF> North American presence through expansion of existing subsidiaries and new acquisitions.

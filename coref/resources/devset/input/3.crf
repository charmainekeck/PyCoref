 A federal judge in Pittsburgh issued a temporary restraining order preventing <COREF ID="3">Trans World Airlines</COREF> from buying <COREF ID="4">additional shares of USAir Group Inc.</COREF> 


 <COREF ID="6">The order</COREF>, requested in a suit filed by <COREF ID="7">USAir</COREF>, dealt <COREF ID="8">another blow</COREF> to TWA's bid to buy the company for $52 a share. 


 <COREF ID="12">Washington-based USAir</COREF>, which reached an agreement Friday to acquire Piedmont Aviation Inc., yesterday began a $69 a share tender offer for all the stock outstanding of Winston-Salem, N.C.,-based Piedmont. 
 The <COREF ID="14">proposed transaction</COREF> has an indicated value of $1.59 billion. 


 Carl C. Icahn, <COREF ID="15">chairman of TWA</COREF>, wouldn't say whether <COREF ID="17">TWA</COREF> would continue its attempt to take over <COREF ID="201">USAir</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="20">Mr. Icahn</COREF> disclosed last week that <COREF ID="21">TWA</COREF> already had become <COREF ID="22">USAir's largest shareholder</COREF>, with a 15% stake as of Friday. 


 Some Wall Street sources and airline industry analysts said they doubted that <COREF ID="24">Mr. Icahn</COREF> would press <COREF ID="25">the attempt</COREF> if <COREF ID="26">USAir</COREF> buys <COREF ID="27">Piedmont</COREF>. 
 "I don't think (<COREF ID="28">TWA</COREF>) has the wherewithal" to buy <COREF ID="29">USAir</COREF> and <COREF ID="30">Piedmont</COREF> combined, said Louis Marckesano, <COREF ID="31">a securities analyst</COREF> at Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. <COREF ID="32">Mr. Marckesano</COREF> said <COREF ID="33">TWA</COREF> and <COREF ID="34">Mr. Icahn</COREF> would need an estimated $3.5 billion to acquire <COREF ID="35">USAir</COREF> once the merger with <COREF ID="36">Piedmont</COREF> is completed. 


 But <COREF ID="37">TWA</COREF>, as expected, yesterday filed a second application with the Department of Transportation for permission to acquire <COREF ID="205">USAir</COREF>. 
 The <COREF ID="40">department</COREF> last week rejected TWA's first application as "deficient" because <COREF ID="42">it</COREF> omitted such important information as the merger's potential impact on competition and pricing. 
 "<COREF ID="43">It</COREF>'s a <COREF ID="44">serious application</COREF>," a <COREF ID="45">department</COREF> official said of the <COREF ID="46">new filing</COREF>. 


 Even so, Wall Street and airline industry sources have continued to view TWA's bid for <COREF ID="202">USAir</COREF> skeptically, seeing <COREF ID="50">it</COREF> as a ploy to pressure <COREF ID="51">USAir</COREF> into buying <COREF ID="52">TWA</COREF>. 


 That view was supported in a <COREF ID="53">tender-offer</COREF> document filed by <COREF ID="54">USAir</COREF> with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in another document filed in court. 
 The filings gave details of conversations between <COREF ID="55">Mr. Icahn</COREF> and Edwin I. Colodny, <COREF ID="56">chairman and chief executive officer</COREF> of <COREF ID="203">USAir</COREF>.
 <COREF ID="58">USAir</COREF> said in <COREF ID="59">the filings</COREF> that <COREF ID="60">Mr. Icahn</COREF> first contacted <COREF ID="61">Mr. Colodny</COREF> last September to discuss the benefits of combining <COREF ID="62">TWA</COREF> and <COREF ID="63">USAir</COREF> -- either by <COREF ID="64">TWA</COREF>'s acquisition of <COREF ID="65">USAir</COREF>, or <COREF ID="66">USAir</COREF>'s acquisition of <COREF ID="67">TWA</COREF>. 


 On Feb. 21, after the <COREF ID="68">USAir</COREF> bid for <COREF ID="69">Piedmont</COREF>, <COREF ID="70">Mr. Icahn</COREF> again called <COREF ID="71">Mr. Colodny</COREF>, according to <COREF ID="72">the documents</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="73">Mr. Icahn</COREF>, <COREF ID="74">the documents</COREF> said, told <COREF ID="75">Mr. Colodny</COREF> that a merger between Piedmont and USAir would put <COREF ID="78">TWA</COREF> in a tough competitive position. 
 <COREF ID="79">Mr. Icahn</COREF> reportedly said <COREF ID="80">he</COREF> "couldn't watch that happen." 
 <COREF ID="81">Mr. Icahn</COREF> then proposed that <COREF ID="82">USAir</COREF> buy <COREF ID="83">TWA</COREF>, or that TWA buy <COREF ID="84">USAir</COREF>. 


 While <COREF ID="85">Mr. Icahn</COREF> is known to have approached several investment bankers in the last week, seeking advice on how to proceed with <COREF ID="86">TWA's offer for USAir</COREF>, Wall Street sources say <COREF ID="89">he</COREF> hasn't retained any investment banking firm in connection with <COREF ID="90">the bid</COREF>. 


 Nevertheless, sources close to <COREF ID="91">USAir</COREF> and <COREF ID="92">Piedmont</COREF> weren't willing to claim victory over <COREF ID="93">Mr. Icahn</COREF> and <COREF ID="94">TWA</COREF>, even though the <COREF ID="95">tender offer for Piedmont</COREF> has begun. 
 "<COREF ID="97">Carl</COREF> is a tenacious fellow," said a source close to <COREF ID="98">USAir</COREF>. 
 "<COREF ID="99">He</COREF> doesn't give up easily and one should never underestimate what <COREF ID="100">he</COREF> can or will do." 
 <COREF ID="101">Mr. Icahn</COREF> couldn't be reached for comment. 


 Sources familiar with <COREF ID="102">Mr. Icahn</COREF> and <COREF ID="103">TWA</COREF> said that, so far, <COREF ID="104">the airline</COREF> is taking a loss on <COREF ID="105">USAir</COREF> shares it bought late last week. 
 <COREF ID="106">TWA</COREF> is understood to have held a 4.9% stake in <COREF ID="107">USAir</COREF> for nearly a year before increasing <COREF ID="108">its</COREF> position to 15% in recent weeks. 
 A source close to <COREF ID="109">Mr. Icahn</COREF> said that the latest stake was bought at prices ranging from about $48.50 a share to more than $50 a share. 
 That would indicate that <COREF ID="110">TWA</COREF> has taken a loss of more than $5 million on its <COREF ID="111">USAir</COREF> shares. 


 <COREF ID="112">TWA</COREF> stock closed at $28, down $2.50 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday. 
 <COREF ID="113">The drop</COREF> reduced the market value of the 22 million shares that <COREF ID="114">Mr. Icahn</COREF> and an <COREF ID="115">Icahn</COREF>-led investor group hold in <COREF ID="116">TWA</COREF> by some $55 million. 
 <COREF ID="117">USAir</COREF> stock fell $3.375 to close at $47.75, and <COREF ID="118">Piedmont</COREF> declined 62.5 cents to $67.625. 


 Wall Street traders said <COREF ID="119">Piedmont</COREF> shares fell partly because of market uncertainty about federal regulatory approval for a <COREF ID="120">merger with USAir</COREF>. 
 But sources close to <COREF ID="122">USAir</COREF> said they didn't believe there would be any problem obtaining approval for <COREF ID="123">the merger</COREF> and pointed out that <COREF ID="124">the company</COREF> plans to complete <COREF ID="125">its tender</COREF>  Paragraphing Error  

Sources close to <COREF ID="127">USAir</COREF> and <COREF ID="128">Piedmont</COREF> conceded that if <COREF ID="129">TWA</COREF>
is permitted to buy more <COREF ID="130">USAir</COREF> shares, it certainly has
enough cash, an estimated $900 million, to do so. Of that
money, about $150 million is committed to the purchase of USX
Corp. shares, in which <COREF ID="131">Mr. Icahn</COREF> currently owns an 11.4%
stake.

 <COREF ID="132">TWA</COREF> hasn't yet filed documents with the <COREF ID="133">SEC</COREF> in connection with <COREF ID="134">its</COREF> <COREF ID="135">USAir</COREF> holding, and it isn't known how much of <COREF ID="136">TWA</COREF>'s money is committed to buying <COREF ID="137">USAir</COREF> shares. 


 Separately, in its SEC filing, <COREF ID="140">USAir</COREF> disclosed details of <COREF ID="141">its</COREF> plans for financing <COREF ID="142">the Piedmont acquisition</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="144">The company</COREF> said <COREF ID="145">it</COREF> received a letter from New York-based Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Friday indicating the <COREF ID="146">bank</COREF>'s willingness to provide as much as $500 million for <COREF ID="147">the purchase</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="148">USAir</COREF> said <COREF ID="149">Manufacturers Hanover</COREF> also is willing to act as agent to raise the remainder of the funds. 


 <COREF ID="150">USAir</COREF> said <COREF ID="151">it</COREF> expects to borrow as much as $2 billion from banks to complete <COREF ID="152">the acquisition</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="153">It</COREF> then plans to refinance the bank loans with proceeds from public or private equity and subordinated debt offerings. 


 <COREF ID="154">The airline</COREF> also said in <COREF ID="155">the filing</COREF> that <COREF ID="156">it</COREF> expects to keep <COREF ID="157">Piedmont</COREF>'s headquarters in Winston-Salem. 
 <COREF ID="158">USAir</COREF> said that William R. Howard, <COREF ID="159">chairman and chief executive of Piedmont</COREF>, will be elected president of <COREF ID="161">USAir</COREF> after <COREF ID="162">the merger</COREF> is completed. 


 Lawyers for <COREF ID="163">TWA</COREF> and <COREF ID="164">USAir</COREF> are due back in court in Pittsburgh this morning to determine whether <COREF ID="165">TWA</COREF> can proceed to buy more USAir stock. 
 <COREF ID="167">USAir</COREF> has asked <COREF ID="168">the court</COREF> to issue a preliminary injunction, enjoining <COREF ID="169">TWA</COREF> from buying <COREF ID="170">more USAir shares</COREF> and from interfering with <COREF ID="172">USAir's tender offer for Piedmont stock</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="175">USAir</COREF> argues that <COREF ID="176">Mr. Icahn</COREF> and <COREF ID="177">TWA</COREF> violated the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act by buying more than $15 million of <COREF ID="178">USAir</COREF> stock without first receiving regulatory approvals. 
 <COREF ID="179">USAir</COREF> also alleges that <COREF ID="180">Mr. Icahn</COREF> and <COREF ID="181">TWA</COREF> weren't entitled to buy more than 10% of <COREF ID="182">USAir</COREF>'s stock without first receiving permission from the <COREF ID="183">Transportation Department</COREF>. 


 A lawyer for <COREF ID="184">TWA</COREF> and <COREF ID="185">Mr. Icahn</COREF>, in an affidavit, denied that <COREF ID="186">TWA</COREF> has done anything wrong by buying a 15% stake in <COREF ID="187">USAir</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="188">TWA</COREF> says that <COREF ID="189">it</COREF> isn't subject to <COREF ID="190">Hart-Scott-Rodino</COREF> regulations and must only seek approval from the <COREF ID="191">Transportation Department</COREF>. 


 Lawyers for <COREF ID="192">TWA</COREF> said that the voting-trust application they filed with the <COREF ID="193">department</COREF> Wednesday allows <COREF ID="194">the airline</COREF> to buy <COREF ID="195">USAir</COREF> stock while a separate application to acquire control of <COREF ID="196">USAir</COREF> is considered. 
 Indeed, <COREF ID="197">TWA</COREF> contends that Houston-based Texas Air Corp. bought more than 9.9% of Eastern Airlines -- which <COREF ID="198">it</COREF> later acquired entirely -- before the <COREF ID="199">department</COREF> approved <COREF ID="200">Texas Air</COREF>'s application to create a trust to hold the shares.

 <COREF ID="1">Sony</COREF> is thinking small in a big way about video. 


 A decade after <COREF ID="2">its</COREF> Betamax home-video format lost out to rival VHS, <COREF ID="3">Sony Corp. of America</COREF>, <COREF ID="4">a unit of the Japanese consumer-electronics giant</COREF>, is trying to force <COREF ID="5">its</COREF> way back into the video limelight with its 8mm format, launched four years ago. 
 <COREF ID="8">Sony</COREF> hopes to popularize <COREF ID="9">"Video 8"</COREF> through the concept of "personal video" -- <COREF ID="10">video wherever you go</COREF> -- as exemplified by its Video Walkman line: <COREF ID="12">tiny battery-operated color mini-TVs</COREF> with built-in videocassette recorders. 


 <COREF ID="13">Sony Corp.</COREF> has heavily promoted <COREF ID="14">the Video Walkman</COREF> since <COREF ID="15">the product</COREF>'s introduction last summer, but Bob Gerson, <COREF ID="16">video editor</COREF> of This Week in Consumer Electronics, says <COREF ID="18">Sony</COREF> conceives of <COREF ID="19">8mm</COREF> as <COREF ID="20">a "family of products, camcorders and VCR decks," whose sales will reinforce one another</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="21">He</COREF> dismisses <COREF ID="22">the Video Walkman</COREF> as <COREF ID="23">an attention-getting gimmick</COREF> aimed mainly at well-heeled trend setters: "At $1,000 a pop, you don't sell many of <COREF ID="24">these things</COREF>." 
 However, <COREF ID="25">he</COREF> adds, "It's no secret that <COREF ID="26">Sony</COREF> is looking at <COREF ID="27">8mm</COREF> as <COREF ID="28">an all-purpose format</COREF>." 


 More important to the future of <COREF ID="29">8mm</COREF> is <COREF ID="30">Sony</COREF>'s success in the $2.3 billion camcorder market. 
 <COREF ID="31">The Japanese company</COREF> already has 12% of <COREF ID="32">the total camcorder market</COREF>, ranking <COREF ID="33">it</COREF> third behind the RCA and Panasonic brands. 


 But 8mm video faces problems and tough competition. 
 For instance, <COREF ID="35">the rival VHS format</COREF> has "really got <COREF ID="36">its</COREF> hooks into the American consumer," says Thomas Chesser, <COREF ID="37">an electronics analyst</COREF> at Smith Barney. 
 And, <COREF ID="38">8mm cassettes</COREF> can't be played on existing VHS equipment. 
 In addition, there's a relative lack of film titles available in <COREF ID="40">8mm</COREF>. 


 The great advantage of <COREF ID="41">8mm</COREF> is size. 
 Over the past four years, 8mm video camcorders have been a big success among home-video buffs and techno-junkies, who have bought more than one million of <COREF ID="43">the compact units</COREF> that record and play videos on tapes the size of audiocassettes. 
 That compares with roughly paperback-book dimensions for <COREF ID="44">VHS</COREF>. 


 Accordingly, most <COREF ID="45">VHS</COREF> camcorders are usually bulky and weigh around eight pounds or more. 
 In contrast, <COREF ID="46">Sony</COREF> this month will introduce <COREF ID="47">a full-featured, $1,500 palm-sized 8mm model, the CCD-TR5 Handycam</COREF>, tipping the scales at less than two pounds. 


 But <COREF ID="50">8mm</COREF> is not automatically the walk-away winner in the compact-camcorder sweepstakes. 
 To compete with <COREF ID="51">Video 8</COREF>, Matsushita Electric Co.'s 51%-owned JVC unit introduced in 1986 a compact version of its dominant VHS format, called <COREF ID="53">VHS-C</COREF>, that is nearly as small as an <COREF ID="54">8mm videocassette</COREF>. 
 And <COREF ID="56">VHS-C</COREF> can be played on existing VHS machines with only a simple adapter; by contrast, <COREF ID="59">8mm tapes</COREF> are incompatible with <COREF ID="61">the VHS machines</COREF>. 


 At present, VHS-C machines can record for only 20 or 30 minutes, while <COREF ID="65">8mm tapes</COREF> run as long as two hours. 
 <COREF ID="67">JVC</COREF> says <COREF ID="68">it</COREF> is developing a 40-minute <COREF ID="69">VHS-C</COREF> cassette and that an enhanced Super VHS version of VHC-C (or <COREF ID="71">S-VHS-C</COREF>) due this fall would be long enough to show a feature film in the extended-play mode with little detectable picture deterioration. 


 This summer, <COREF ID="72">JVC</COREF> launched an ad campaign emphasizing the <COREF ID="73">VHS-C</COREF>'s compatibility advantage over <COREF ID="74">8mm</COREF>, while its sister company, Panasonic, recently cut list prices $100 to $200 on some of <COREF ID="78">its VHS-C models</COREF>, to as low as $799. 
 List prices on <COREF ID="81">Sony</COREF>'s camcorders begin at $1,300. 


 Another problem for <COREF ID="82">Sony</COREF> is that while nearly every movie title is available on <COREF ID="83">VHS</COREF> cassettes, there are currently only about 1,400 titles on <COREF ID="84">8mm video</COREF>. 
 Of <COREF ID="86">those</COREF>, roughly 250 are feature films; the rest are video magazines, instructional films and documentaries. 
 At present, <COREF ID="87">Sony</COREF> <COREF ID="88">itself</COREF> is the primary distributor of <COREF ID="89">prerecorded 8mm tapes</COREF> through <COREF ID="91">its</COREF> mail-order Cinema 8 movie club. 


 Bill Fisher, <COREF ID="92">national software-marketing manager</COREF> with Sony Video Products Co., says the company is adding three titles a month through licensing agreements with the home-video units of Paramount Communications Inc., Nelson Entertainment Co. and Warner Communications Inc. 
 For <COREF ID="95">its</COREF> part, <COREF ID="96">the unit of what will soon be Time Warner Inc.</COREF>, entered the market last fall with 33 older catalog titles, and this year will release 20 new <COREF ID="97">8mm</COREF> titles. 
 And other companies, such as MGM/UA Communications Co. and RCA/Columbia have agreed to license some older titles to <COREF ID="98">Sony</COREF>. 


 Some studios remain hesitant to enter <COREF ID="99">the market</COREF> because there isn't a critical mass of <COREF ID="100">8mm machines</COREF> in consumers' homes. 
 "It's the proverbial chicken and egg situation," says George Krieger, president and chief executive officer of CBS/Fox Home Video, <COREF ID="103">a leading videocassette distributor</COREF> that is a joint venture of CBS Inc. and News Corp.'s 20th Century Fox studio, which isn't supplying any 8mm tapes at present. 
 Likewise, MCA Inc.'s home-video unit, which distributes movies made by Universal Studios, says <COREF ID="109">it</COREF>'s looking at <COREF ID="110">the business</COREF> but isn't in <COREF ID="111">it</COREF> yet. 


 And video retailers are entering <COREF ID="112">the market</COREF> warily. 
 Tower Records, <COREF ID="113">a 50-store audio and video retail chain</COREF> based in Sacramento, Calif., has been "testing" <COREF ID="114">8mm</COREF> software sales since April in 12 of <COREF ID="115">its</COREF> leading stores. 
 John Thrasher, <COREF ID="116">Tower's top video buyer</COREF>, says <COREF ID="118">he</COREF> is "really pleased" with most of the test locations, but hastens to add: "<COREF ID="119">I</COREF> don't know how big of an investment that <COREF ID="120">we</COREF> as <COREF ID="121">a retailer</COREF> can invest in <COREF ID="122">another video format</COREF>." 
 In any case, <COREF ID="123">he</COREF> says <COREF ID="124">he</COREF> intends to keep at least "a representation of some really hot titles" in <COREF ID="125">8mm</COREF>. 


 Minneapolis-based Musicland Group announced last Friday that <COREF ID="126">it</COREF> will begin test marketing of <COREF ID="127">prerecorded 8mm cassettes</COREF> at 19 of <COREF ID="129">its</COREF> 745 audio and video outlets this month. 
 RKO-Warner Video Inc., <COREF ID="130">a 31-store New York-area chain</COREF>, is also dipping <COREF ID="131">its</COREF> toe into the <COREF ID="132">8mm</COREF> pool this month. 
 "<COREF ID="133">We</COREF> want to be there if there is <COREF ID="134">a business</COREF> in <COREF ID="135">8mm</COREF>," says Jeff Levy, <COREF ID="136">RKO-Warner vice president</COREF>, for purchasing. 


 Despite the heat of competition, <COREF ID="138">Mr. Gerson</COREF> of This Week in Consumer Electronics thinks <COREF ID="140">Sony</COREF> can succeed in the <COREF ID="141">home-video market</COREF> in the same way <COREF ID="142">it</COREF> has thrived in the highly competitive color-television-set market. 
 "<COREF ID="143">Sony</COREF> only has 8% of <COREF ID="144">the market</COREF>," <COREF ID="145">he</COREF> explains, "but <COREF ID="146">they</COREF> have 20% of the {high-end} market they want, and <COREF ID="148">that</COREF>'s not bad."

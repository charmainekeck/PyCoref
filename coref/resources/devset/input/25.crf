 Eastern Pilots Win Round
@  In Battle Over Back Pay

 <COREF ID="3">Eastern Airlines pilots</COREF> won a round in bankruptcy court that <COREF ID="6">they</COREF> say could bring <COREF ID="7">them</COREF> as much as $250 million in back pay, but an arbitrator must decide how much -- if anything -- <COREF ID="9">they</COREF> are owed. 


 The decision by Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland in New York will allow the Air Line Pilots Association to go forward with a claim that a "pay parity" clause in their contract was triggered when another Eastern union received a pay raise. 


 All legal proceedings against Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., were put on hold when <COREF ID="20">Eastern</COREF> filed for bankruptcy-law protection March 9. 
 But <COREF ID="22">Judge Lifland</COREF> lifted that stay to let <COREF ID="23">the three-year-old back-pay claim</COREF> go to arbitration, provided <COREF ID="25">that process</COREF> is swift. 
 If <COREF ID="26">it</COREF> doesn't go quickly enough, <COREF ID="27">the judge</COREF> said <COREF ID="28">he</COREF> may invoke a provision of <COREF ID="29">the bankruptcy code</COREF> that would let <COREF ID="31">him</COREF> estimate what <COREF ID="32">pilots</COREF> are owed. 
 <COREF ID="33">The arbitration</COREF> is scheduled to begin Aug. 9. 


 At issue is <COREF ID="34">a three-year-old effort</COREF> by the pilots to prove they had a valid contract in 1986, and that Eastern violated a clause in it that would give them raises if any other group got raises. 
 Shortly after <COREF ID="50">Texas Air</COREF> took over <COREF ID="45">Eastern</COREF>, management supervisors for the machinists' union received a 20% pay raise. 


 <COREF ID="48">The pilots</COREF> have won two rounds of <COREF ID="49">this battle</COREF> in federal court, with federal district court and an appeals court deciding that the pilots' contract was valid. 
 Neither court, however, ruled on the merits of <COREF ID="52">their claim</COREF>.

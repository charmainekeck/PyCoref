 Chrysler to Create Grievance Process For Non-Union Staff

 <COREF ID="2">Chrysler Corp.</COREF> this year will take the highly unusual step of setting up <COREF ID="3">a formal grievance procedure</COREF> for its non-union white-collar employees. 


 "<COREF ID="6">We</COREF> understand that (<COREF ID="7">Chrysler</COREF>'s) dramatic restructuring . . . will inevitably lead many employees to question management's decisions and actions," Anthony P. St. John, <COREF ID="8">vice president for human resources</COREF> of the auto maker's Chrysler Motors subsidiary, said in a speech at Oakland University <COREF ID="10">here</COREF> yesterday. 
 "Employees may not feel that <COREF ID="11">they</COREF> are being treated fairly." 


 To "strengthen <COREF ID="12">management</COREF>'s credibility," <COREF ID="13">Mr. St. John</COREF> added, <COREF ID="14">the company</COREF> will set up <COREF ID="15">an "alternative disputes resolution" system</COREF> similar to a traditional union grievance procedure. 


 "For the first time <COREF ID="16">these employees</COREF> will be guaranteed <COREF ID="17">a formal and impartial internal mechanism</COREF> to resolve discipline, discharge, and employment opportunity disputes," <COREF ID="18">Mr. St. John</COREF> said. 


 <COREF ID="19">The process</COREF> will have several steps, concluding with final arbitration handled by a neutral third party. 


 Chrysler's move apparently was inspired by the turmoil created by <COREF ID="21">its</COREF> current cost-cutting and restructuring, forces which are transforming many industrial companies. 
 <COREF ID="22">The auto maker</COREF> is significantly changing wage and benefit plans, and is trying to slash <COREF ID="23">its</COREF> white-collar rolls, particularly in the wake of <COREF ID="24">its</COREF> acquisition last year of American Motors Corp. 


 <COREF ID="25">Chrysler</COREF> has <COREF ID="26">about 31,000 white-collar employees in the U.S.</COREF>, up sharply from roughly 21,000 in 1982. 
 About 6,000 salaried workers are currently represented by the United Auto Workers union. 
 Some analysts speculated <COREF ID="27">the move</COREF> is designed to stave off further union organizing in <COREF ID="28">the white-collar ranks</COREF>. 


 Several management consultants said <COREF ID="29">a formal grievance procedure with third-party arbitration</COREF> was common for government employees, but <COREF ID="30">they</COREF> had never heard of such <COREF ID="31">a policy</COREF> for non-union employees at a major private company. 


 "<COREF ID="32">It</COREF> has the potential of undermining supervisory and management responsibility and authority," said Jerrold Bratkovich, <COREF ID="33">a vice president</COREF> in the Los Angeles office of the Hay Group, a management consulting firm. 
 "That's one of the main reasons employers don't want to have unionization." 


 A Chrysler spokesman said <COREF ID="37">the company</COREF> had studied "a couple" of other companies that had <COREF ID="38">arbitration for nonunion employees</COREF>, but <COREF ID="39">he</COREF> couldn't recall which companies. 


 A more common business approach is the "open-door" policy such as that at International Business Machines Corp., where "any employee who has a problem which has not been resolved to satisfaction . . . can bring the complaint to the attention of higher management," said an IBM spokesman. 


 "If the employee is still not satisfied, the problem can be reviewed with the <COREF ID="41">IBM</COREF> chief executive officer," <COREF ID="42">the spokesman</COREF> added. 


 <COREF ID="43">Chrysler</COREF> will implement <COREF ID="44">its system</COREF> later this year. 
 The details haven't yet been worked out, <COREF ID="46">Chrysler</COREF> said. 


 According to a slide used in <COREF ID="47">Mr. St. John</COREF>'s presentation, <COREF ID="48">the policy</COREF> would cover all "professional, administrative, management and executive employees." 
 <COREF ID="49">It</COREF> would also have <COREF ID="50">a four-step grievance process</COREF>, just as <COREF ID="51">UAW</COREF>-represented workers have.

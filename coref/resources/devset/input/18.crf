 U.S. Mediator Says Eastern Negotiations Are Progressing and Near Critical Stage

 After months of quiet and productive meetings, negotiators in the bitter labor battle at Eastern Airlines are approaching a critical phase in <COREF ID="3">the talks</COREF>, <COREF ID="4">a federal mediator</COREF> said. 


 <COREF ID="5">Harry Bickford</COREF>, who has been supervising the talks in Miami, since last fall, said that <COREF ID="8">representatives</COREF> of the company and the International Association of Machinists have been meeting almost daily since January and have resolved hundreds of differences. 
 "We are down to the point that within a short time <COREF ID="11">we</COREF> will be coming to terms with the gut issues," <COREF ID="12">he</COREF> said. 


 <COREF ID="13">Mr. Bickford</COREF>'s comments are the first indication that progress has occurred in <COREF ID="14">the high-stakes, 16-month confrontation over labor costs</COREF>. 
 Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., is seeking steep wage cuts from its roughly 10,000 machinists and baggage handlers as part of a plan to restore <COREF ID="18">the ailing carrier</COREF> to profitability, and <COREF ID="19">it</COREF> has shrunk <COREF ID="20">its</COREF> capacity about 13% in the past year while seeking <COREF ID="21">the cost concessions</COREF>. 


 In an interview, <COREF ID="22">Mr. Bickford</COREF> acknowledged that the ever-growing clamor of public demonstrations, letter-writing campaigns and political lobbying have heightened antagonism at the bargaining table. 
 "Litigation, charges, counter-charges -- <COREF ID="23">I</COREF>'m used to that," said <COREF ID="24">Mr. Bickford, an 18-year mediation veteran</COREF>. 
 "But the extent to which <COREF ID="25">it</COREF> has gone in this case is unparalleled. 
 <COREF ID="26">I</COREF> have never faced anything like <COREF ID="27">it</COREF>." 


 Nevertheless, <COREF ID="28">"We</COREF> are still talking," <COREF ID="29">Mr. Bickford</COREF> asserted, "and have been every day since the 26th of January, with the exception of three periods totaling 10 days." 


 <COREF ID="30">Mr. Bickford</COREF> expressed anger at the growing perception that the mediation process was fruitless and futile. 
 Last week, for instance, Florida Gov. Bob Martinez issued a news release saying that "<COREF ID="31">mediation</COREF> has reached a stalemate and both sides should be allowed to return to <COREF ID="32">the bargaining table</COREF>." 


 And for <COREF ID="33">their</COREF> part, <COREF ID="34">Eastern</COREF> officials continue to lobby for the National Mediation Board to impose a deadline on <COREF ID="35">the talks</COREF>, without which management contends an agreement on a wage-concession package is all but impossible. 
 Under U.S. labor law applying to airlines, the mediator may declare an impasse and begin a 30-day countdown, after which management may unilaterally impose <COREF ID="37">its</COREF> last contract offer and the union is free to strike. 


 "I don't believe there is any prospect of getting <COREF ID="38">a negotiated settlement</COREF>," said <COREF ID="39">Phil Bakes</COREF>, <COREF ID="40">president and chief executive officer of Eastern</COREF>, "until there is a firm date when the existing contract comes to an end." 


 <COREF ID="43">The union</COREF> says that <COREF ID="44">it</COREF> is bargaining seriously and that each side has made concessions. 
 <COREF ID="45">A settlement through mediation</COREF> is possible, "absolutely," said Charles Bryan, <COREF ID="46">head of the machinists' union at Eastern</COREF>. 
 "<COREF ID="49">I</COREF> have never called a strike at <COREF ID="50">Eastern</COREF>," <COREF ID="51">he</COREF> said. 


 Indeed, <COREF ID="52">the Machinists union</COREF> -- as well as the pilot and flight attendant unions at <COREF ID="53">Eastern</COREF>, from whom <COREF ID="54">management</COREF> will also seek concessions in the coming months -- is anxious to avoid <COREF ID="55">a strike</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="56">Eastern</COREF> has made elaborate preparations to keep <COREF ID="57">the airline</COREF> flying with non-union workers. 


 Even as <COREF ID="58">talks</COREF> continue under <COREF ID="59">Mr. Bickford</COREF>, neither side shows any sign of relenting in public. 
 Last week, <COREF ID="60">Eastern</COREF> ran newspaper advertising featuring Frank Borman, <COREF ID="61">the former astronaut and former Eastern president</COREF>, saying the federal investigation of Texas Air resulted from a union "whisper campaign" alleging <COREF ID="65">the airline</COREF> is unsafe. 
 A week earlier, <COREF ID="66">Eastern</COREF> sued the <COREF ID="67">Machinist</COREF> and <COREF ID="68">pilot unions</COREF>, accusing <COREF ID="69">them</COREF> of a criminal conspiracy to drive down <COREF ID="70">Texas Air</COREF>'s stock price. 
 <COREF ID="71">Eastern</COREF> and <COREF ID="72">Texas Air</COREF> are also urging employees and shareholders to write their members of Congress demanding that <COREF ID="73">the National Mediation Board</COREF> begin the 30-day countdown in <COREF ID="74">the talks</COREF>. 


 And Thursday, about 3,000 <COREF ID="75">union</COREF> members took part in a lunch-time demonstration in downtown Miami against <COREF ID="76">Texas Air</COREF> and <COREF ID="77">Gov. Martinez</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="78">Mr. Bickford</COREF> said <COREF ID="79">he</COREF> was so upset by the level and tenor of the recent clamor, that <COREF ID="80">the talks</COREF> were moved for a period in April from Miami, where Eastern is based, to Boston, where <COREF ID="83">he</COREF> hoped things would be quieter.

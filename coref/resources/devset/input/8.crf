 Striking auto workers and Chrysler Corp.'s Canadian unit appeared to be making progress in negotiations yesterday, as <COREF ID="4">the company</COREF> said <COREF ID="5">it</COREF> planned to make <COREF ID="6">a new contract offer</COREF> by this morning. 


 Meanwhile, in Dearborn, Mich., Ford Motor Co. and the United Auto Workers union continued <COREF ID="9">negotiations</COREF> into the evening <COREF ID="10">yesterday</COREF>, but neither side would officially discuss progress. 


 Early in <COREF ID="11">the day</COREF>, bargaining committee members had reported to <COREF ID="12">their</COREF> <COREF ID="13">union</COREF> locals that a settlement was imminent. 
 Still, <COREF ID="14">negotiations</COREF> dragged on. 
 Late last night <COREF ID="15">union</COREF> officials were still hoping to announce <COREF ID="16">a settlement</COREF> by early this morning. 


 UAW President Owen Bieber was absent from the talks all day. 
 <COREF ID="18">The 57-year-old union leader</COREF> checked into Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit Tuesday night for testing because of abdominal pain, one source said. 
 The tests ruled out any heart problems, and <COREF ID="20">Mr. Bieber</COREF> was apparently in "good condition," <COREF ID="21">the source</COREF> said. 
 <COREF ID="22">He</COREF> added that <COREF ID="23">Mr. Bieber</COREF>'s hospitalization doesn't affect the pace of <COREF ID="24">negotiations</COREF>. 
 A <COREF ID="25">UAW</COREF> spokesman would neither confirm nor deny the report. 


 In Toronto, Robert White, <COREF ID="26">president of the Canadian Auto Workers union</COREF>, said <COREF ID="28">he</COREF> expects <COREF ID="29">the new offer</COREF> from <COREF ID="30">Chrysler Canada Ltd.</COREF> to contain sweetened cost-of-living adjustments for pensioners. 


 The Canadian union has made <COREF ID="32">inflation-indexed pension payments</COREF> <COREF ID="34">its</COREF> top priority in <COREF ID="35">the talks</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="36">Mr. White</COREF> said negotiators "unlocked the logjam on the main issue" after all-night meetings <COREF ID="37">Tuesday</COREF> and <COREF ID="38">yesterday</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="39">The union</COREF> struck <COREF ID="40">Chrysler Canada</COREF> <COREF ID="41">Tuesday</COREF> after rejecting <COREF ID="42">a company</COREF> offer on pension adjustments. 
 <COREF ID="44">The union</COREF> said the size of <COREF ID="45">the adjustments</COREF> was inadequate. 


 But Chrysler Canada's chief negotiator, <COREF ID="47">William Fisher</COREF>, said <COREF ID="48">yesterday</COREF> that the two sides had reached "some understandings" on economic issues, including pensions. 
 "<COREF ID="50">We</COREF> have a good chance of wrapping something up by <COREF ID="51">the end of the week</COREF>," <COREF ID="52">he</COREF> said. 


 <COREF ID="53">Mr. White</COREF> allowed negotiations on local issues to resume <COREF ID="54">yesterday</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="55">About 200 local issues</COREF> that remain unsettled had been suspended while the <COREF ID="56">CAW</COREF> and <COREF ID="57">Chrysler</COREF> grappled with <COREF ID="58">the pension issue</COREF>. 


 If a settlement comes <COREF ID="60">today</COREF> or tomorrow, <COREF ID="61">Chrysler</COREF>'s 10,000 Canadian workers could vote on <COREF ID="62">a contract</COREF> <COREF ID="63">this weekend</COREF>, when <COREF ID="64">the union</COREF> has scheduled membership meetings for <COREF ID="65">the striking workers</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="66">Chrysler</COREF> said <COREF ID="67">its</COREF> four Canadian plants could resume production Monday if <COREF ID="68">a new pact</COREF> is accepted. 


 A <COREF ID="69">company</COREF> spokesman said about 2,285 workers remain on layoff at two U.S. plants as a result of <COREF ID="70">the Canadian strike</COREF>. 
 As previously reported, <COREF ID="71">Chrysler</COREF> stopped output of Dodge Dynasty and Chrysler New Yorker cars yesterday at its Belvidere, Ill., plant because of a shortage of Canadian-made parts. 
 Some 1,700 of <COREF ID="73">the plant</COREF>'s 2,900 hourly employees were laid off as a result. 


 Also, about 585 workers were laid off at a stamping plant near Detroit because the parts <COREF ID="75">they</COREF> make aren't needed in Canada during <COREF ID="76">the strike</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="77">That plant</COREF> normally employs 2,800 hourly workers. 


 The <COREF ID="78">CAW</COREF>'s contracts with <COREF ID="79">Chrysler</COREF> and the Canadian units of General Motors Corp. and <COREF ID="80">Ford Motor Co.</COREF> expired Monday. 
 Talks with <COREF ID="81">GM</COREF> and <COREF ID="82">Ford</COREF> are on hold pending the outcome of <COREF ID="83">the Chrysler talks</COREF>. 


 In <COREF ID="85">the Ford-UAW talks</COREF>, the two parties turned to economics <COREF ID="88">yesterday</COREF> in addition to the job-security issue. 
 Sources said <COREF ID="90">Ford</COREF> expressed willingness to offer some sort of base-wage raise, or annual improvement factor, but it wasn't clear how much or for how many years. 
 In the previous contract, <COREF ID="91">the company</COREF> made lump-sum payments instead of base-wage raises in two of the three years. 
 <COREF ID="92">It</COREF> offered no base-wage raises in <COREF ID="93">its</COREF> initial proposal this year. 


 On <COREF ID="94">the job-security issue</COREF>, it is understood that <COREF ID="96">Ford</COREF> agreed not to lay off any workers during the life of the contract except during a major sales plunge. 
 <COREF ID="97">The company</COREF> also promised to replace half of all workers leaving <COREF ID="98">the company</COREF>. 
 At last report, <COREF ID="99">the two sides</COREF> were still haggling over details of the job-security plan, while also discussing the wage and benefit package. 


 <COREF ID="101">The contract</COREF> expired at midnight <COREF ID="102">Monday</COREF>, but <COREF ID="103">the union</COREF>, citing progress, agreed to an indefinite extension. 


 The <COREF ID="104">UAW</COREF>'s contract with <COREF ID="105">GM</COREF> also expired <COREF ID="106">Monday</COREF>, but negotiations with <COREF ID="107">the No. 1 auto maker</COREF> were postponed pending a settlement with <COREF ID="108">Ford</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="109">Chrysler</COREF>'s <COREF ID="110">U.S.</COREF> contract doesn't expire until next year. 


 <COREF ID="111">Yesterday</COREF> in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, <COREF ID="112">Chrysler</COREF> closed at $42.25, down $1. 
 <COREF ID="113">Ford</COREF> closed at $104, down 62.5 cents.

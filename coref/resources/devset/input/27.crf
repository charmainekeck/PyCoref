 <COREF ID="3">A six-month confrontation</COREF> between Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and a technicians union appears to be ending, in plenty of time for the fall season. 


 <COREF ID="6">ABC</COREF> said more than 2,000 out of about 2,150 employees belonging to <COREF ID="7">the union</COREF> have ratified a new four-year contract. 
 A few small work units rejected <COREF ID="8">the contract</COREF>, <COREF ID="9">ABC</COREF> said, but are expected to be persuaded to approve <COREF ID="10">it</COREF> soon. 
 A <COREF ID="11">union</COREF> press release said <COREF ID="12">the union</COREF> will schedule further negotiations "as soon as possible" for <COREF ID="13">the units that rejected the offer</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="15">The National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians</COREF> represents mostly engineers, camera operators and tape editors at <COREF ID="16">the network</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="17">ABC</COREF> applauded <COREF ID="18">the new contract</COREF>, which gives the network more flexibility in such areas as hiring temporary crews. 
 Two years ago, <COREF ID="20">the union</COREF> and NBC fought over work rules, which led to a 17-week strike.

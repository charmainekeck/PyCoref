 As senior director of UAL, and a member of the executive committee of its board, <COREF ID="3">I</COREF> am appalled at the inaccuracies and anti-management bias in the Journal's April 17 article about Richard Ferris, <COREF ID="6">UAL's chief executive officer</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="8">The UAL board</COREF> is four-square behind <COREF ID="10">Mr. Ferris</COREF>, <COREF ID="11">his</COREF> management team and <COREF ID="12">his</COREF> long-range strategy of making United a more competitive airline by combining <COREF ID="14">it</COREF> with the premier hotel company and car rental company. 
 Contrary to what <COREF ID="15">the Journal article</COREF> suggests, board members have not been dissatisfied with the financial performance of <COREF ID="18">Westin Hotels</COREF> and <COREF ID="19">Hertz</COREF>. 


 Like <COREF ID="20">Mr. Ferris</COREF>, <COREF ID="21">the directors</COREF> have been dissatisfied with the earnings of United Airlines. 
 <COREF ID="23">We</COREF> share <COREF ID="24">his</COREF> determination to improve <COREF ID="25">them</COREF>. 
 But <COREF ID="26">we</COREF> recognize that fare wars begun by non-union airline competitors have been responsible for a large part of <COREF ID="27">our</COREF> difficulties. 
 <COREF ID="28">Mr. Ferris</COREF> and Jim Hartigan, <COREF ID="29">president of United</COREF>, are taking steps to improve <COREF ID="31">its earnings</COREF>. 
 First-quarter financial results of <COREF ID="33">the airline</COREF> should show a substantial improvement over comparable 1986 results, raising the prospect of a much better year-over-year financial performance in 1987. 


 Contrary to the implication in <COREF ID="34">your article</COREF>, the fact that the outside directors have employed independent legal and financial counsel in response to the pilots' proposal to purchase <COREF ID="36">United</COREF> does not bespeak a lack of confidence in <COREF ID="37">Mr. Ferris</COREF>. 
 The employment of <COREF ID="38">independent counsel</COREF> by outside directors is standard procedure in proposed corporate buyout situations. 


 The Journal's reference to Donald Trump's reputed desire to cause the breakup of <COREF ID="40">UAL</COREF> so that <COREF ID="41">he</COREF> can own the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles ignores an important fact: <COREF ID="42">UAL</COREF> does not own <COREF ID="43">the Century Plaza</COREF>. 


 Most unfair and inaccurate was <COREF ID="44">the Journal</COREF>'s reference to the case of the "570 newly hired pilots" whom United "tried to fire" because they "refused to cross picket lines." 
 <COREF ID="48">These</COREF> are <COREF ID="49">pilots</COREF> who in 1985 were offered and accepted pre-hiring training with the knowledge they would be expected to fly if United's service were to be disrupted by a strike later that year. 


 When the pilots' strike occurred, <COREF ID="56">the trainees</COREF> declined to cross the picket line; thus, <COREF ID="58">United</COREF> declined to hire <COREF ID="59">them</COREF>. 
 In litigation that arose out of <COREF ID="60">the strike</COREF>, a federal district court ruled that <COREF ID="61">the 570 individuals</COREF> must be hired by <COREF ID="62">United</COREF>, and <COREF ID="63">they</COREF> have been flying in <COREF ID="64">United</COREF> cockpits ever since. 


 Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a circuit court reversal of <COREF ID="65">the district court</COREF>, and held that <COREF ID="66">United</COREF> was not required to hire <COREF ID="67">the 570 pilots</COREF>. 
 However, in an effort to let bygones be bygones, <COREF ID="68">United</COREF> management declined to take advantage of <COREF ID="69">its</COREF> court victory, and <COREF ID="70">it</COREF> retained <COREF ID="71">the 570 pilots</COREF> with seniority dating from 1985 when <COREF ID="73">they</COREF> actually began flying for <COREF ID="74">United</COREF>. 


 Neither <COREF ID="75">Mr. Ferris</COREF> nor <COREF ID="76">the board of directors</COREF> has any desire to "break" the pilots' union. 
 If harsh things were said by either side in the heat of <COREF ID="78">the 1985 pilot strike</COREF>, or since, we regret <COREF ID="81">them</COREF>, and want to forget <COREF ID="82">them</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="83">We</COREF> like and admire <COREF ID="84">our pilots</COREF>, who are the best in the business, and <COREF ID="85">we</COREF> respect <COREF ID="86">their</COREF> right to have a strong union. 
 <COREF ID="87">We</COREF> are sure that, likewise, <COREF ID="88">they</COREF> want <COREF ID="89">us</COREF> to do <COREF ID="90">our</COREF> best to keep <COREF ID="91">United</COREF> a strong and prosperous employer.

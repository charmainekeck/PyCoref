 Northwest Attendants Snub Airline's Contract Changes 
 
 NWA LABOR 
 AIR 
 ST. PAUL, Minn.  


 <COREF ID="4">The Northwest Airlines flight attendants union</COREF> said new wage and work rules <COREF ID="7">the NWA Inc. unit</COREF> has proposed are "unacceptable," and renewed a strike threat. 


 Seeking to end a yearlong stalemate with <COREF ID="9">the union</COREF>, as previously reported, <COREF ID="10">Northwest</COREF> said Wednesday it plans unilaterally to impose new contract terms on <COREF ID="11">the attendants</COREF> April 1. 
 <COREF ID="12">Union</COREF> leaders complained <COREF ID="13">Northwest</COREF> is trying to "force a <COREF ID="14">strike</COREF>" and issued a statement advising passengers with reservations on <COREF ID="15">Northwest</COREF> over the Easter holidays to "make other arrangements." 


 <COREF ID="16">The union</COREF>, <COREF ID="17">a Teamsters chapter</COREF>, invited leaders of the unions representing Northwest pilots and machinists to a strategy meeting Monday in Washington. 
 The Teamsters have yet to win guarantees that the other unions would participate in a <COREF ID="24">walkout</COREF>. 
 An Air Line Pilots Association spokesman said <COREF ID="25">union leaders</COREF> haven't decided whether to attend <COREF ID="26">the meeting</COREF>. 
 A spokesman for the machinists, <COREF ID="28">Northwest's largest union</COREF>, couldn't be reached for comment. 


 A Northwest spokesman said management is "disappointed" by <COREF ID="31">the union</COREF>'s threat to disrupt <COREF ID="32">holiday</COREF> service. 
 "<COREF ID="33">We</COREF> had hoped that if <COREF ID="34">they</COREF> didn't like the imposed (contract) policy, <COREF ID="35">they</COREF> would come back to bargaining table and get something better for <COREF ID="36">themselves</COREF>," <COREF ID="37">he</COREF> said. 
 <COREF ID="38">The attendants union</COREF> also called on <COREF ID="40">the company</COREF>'s board to replace Chairman Steven G. Rothmeier with "competent management."

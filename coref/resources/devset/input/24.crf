 Who's News: Dabah Creates Pricey Image for the Masses

 Gitano Group Inc. President Haim Dabah likes to think of <COREF ID="2">his</COREF> company as "the Liz Claiborne of <COREF ID="4">the masses</COREF>." 


 While <COREF ID="5">Liz Claiborne Inc.</COREF> and other high-fashion womenswear makers sell their clothes through department stores and pricey boutiques, <COREF ID="6">Gitano</COREF>'s market is distinctly middle American. 
 <COREF ID="7">Its</COREF> outlets are mass merchandisers and discount chains such as K mart Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 


 But like <COREF ID="8">its more glamorous competitors</COREF>, <COREF ID="10">Gitano</COREF> puts heavy emphasis on advertising and promotion to create a fashion image for its clothes. 
 In fact, company focus groups indicate Gitano customers associate <COREF ID="13">the brand</COREF> with fashionable department stores like Bloomingdale's and Neiman-Marcus even though <COREF ID="14">it</COREF>'s primarily sold through <COREF ID="15">mass merchandisers</COREF>. 


 That perception has been credited to <COREF ID="16">Mr. Dabah</COREF>, who "has a great flair for marketing and presentation," says Stanley Greenstein, <COREF ID="18">Gitano chief financial officer</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="20">Gitano</COREF>'s <COREF ID="21">marketing</COREF> strategy seems to be paying off. 
 While much of the apparel industry is in the doldrums, <COREF ID="22">Gitano</COREF> is posting big increases in revenue and earnings. 
 Monday, <COREF ID="23">the company</COREF> said third-quarter earnings jumped 62.2% to <COREF ID="24">$4.1 million</COREF> on sales of $119.1 million. 


 Its stock, which was priced at $20.50 a share when the company went public on Sept. 30, dropped a total of $2 on <COREF ID="29">Monday</COREF> and Tuesday. 
 But analysts didn't see any significance in the drop, since <COREF ID="30">it</COREF>'s a relatively new issue and <COREF ID="31">it</COREF>'s thinly traded -- <COREF ID="32">Mr. Dabah</COREF> and <COREF ID="33">his</COREF> family still control 78% of <COREF ID="34">the company</COREF>. 
 Yesterday <COREF ID="35">the stock</COREF> gained 12.5 cents to close at $15.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 


 Norman G. Fosback, <COREF ID="36">editor</COREF> of New Issues, an investment newsletter, notes that investors, familiar with the up-and-down cycles on Seventh Avenue, may be skeptical as to whether <COREF ID="37">Gitano</COREF> can fly any higher. 
 "<COREF ID="38">One</COREF> wonders how long can <COREF ID="39">they</COREF> go on like this," <COREF ID="40">he</COREF> says. 


 <COREF ID="41">Wal-Mart</COREF>, of Bentonville, Ark., says that in the two years <COREF ID="42">it</COREF> has carried <COREF ID="43">the brand</COREF>, <COREF ID="44">Gitano</COREF> has grown to become <COREF ID="45">one</COREF> of its top apparel resources, selling "better than others in the same price range."
 <COREF ID="48">WalMart</COREF> attributes <COREF ID="49">Gitano</COREF>'s success to <COREF ID="50">its</COREF> high-profile <COREF ID="51">marketing</COREF> techniques and close monitoring of sales trends. 


 <COREF ID="52">Mr. Dabah</COREF> "firmly believes that after you sell to the retailer, it's just <COREF ID="53">the beginning</COREF>," <COREF ID="54">Mr. Greenstein</COREF> says. 


 For example, <COREF ID="55">discount</COREF> stores are strictly self-service, so <COREF ID="56">Gitano</COREF> attaches big, colored tags on <COREF ID="57">clothes</COREF> to show <COREF ID="58">customers</COREF> how <COREF ID="59">they</COREF> can fashionably pair tops and bottoms, a tactic that also induces multiple sales. 


 <COREF ID="60">Mr. Dabah</COREF>, a vivacious salesman, compares <COREF ID="61">himself</COREF> to "a baseball player coming to work." 
 <COREF ID="62">He</COREF> relishes cooking up new <COREF ID="63">marketing</COREF> strategies, listing such projects as mail-in rebates and gift certificates with a purchase. 
 In the past three years, <COREF ID="64">the company</COREF> also held a nationwide "<COREF ID="65">Gitano</COREF> Girl" model-search contest. 
 At Bradlees stores, <COREF ID="66">Gitano</COREF> recently sponsored a <COREF ID="67">sales</COREF> contest for department managers with prizes like trips to Club Med and color televisions. 
 The result: <COREF ID="68">sales of Gitano clothes</COREF> were up 180% at <COREF ID="70">Bradlees</COREF> in one month. 


 As part of <COREF ID="71">his</COREF> hectic day, <COREF ID="72">Mr. Dabah</COREF> touches base with <COREF ID="73">his</COREF> brothers, Isaac, <COREF ID="74">the company's vice chairman</COREF>, who oversees Gitano's production at its factories in 31 countries, and Ezra, <COREF ID="79">president</COREF> of Gitano's children's wear division. 


 <COREF ID="81">Mr. Dabah</COREF>, whose father Morris -- chairman of the company -- founded Gitano 17 years ago after emigrating from Israel, says a major reason <COREF ID="86">the company</COREF> sells through <COREF ID="87">mass merchandisers</COREF> is because it's easier to keep costs down. 
 <COREF ID="88">Gitano</COREF>'s staple products -- <COREF ID="89">tops</COREF> and <COREF ID="90">bottoms for women that sell for around $20</COREF> -- don't have "major <COREF ID="91">fashion</COREF> risks," <COREF ID="92">he</COREF> says. 
 That means <COREF ID="93">Gitano</COREF> can commit to styles months ahead of when <COREF ID="94">they</COREF>'re needed and keep <COREF ID="95">its</COREF> factory contractors operating in slack periods. 


 <COREF ID="97">Gitano</COREF> also has the luxury of always shipping <COREF ID="98">its goods</COREF> by sea instead of air. 
 Any sudden <COREF ID="100">fashion</COREF> shift won't reach the mass market until a season or two later, anyway. 
 The <COREF ID="101">cost</COREF> savings can be passed on to <COREF ID="102">Gitano</COREF>'s retailers, allowing <COREF ID="103">the company</COREF>, for example, to keep the wholesale price of <COREF ID="104">its</COREF> jeans at $10 when "Lee is at $15.75 to $16.50," <COREF ID="105">Mr. Dabah</COREF> says. 


 <COREF ID="106">The company</COREF> works to keep <COREF ID="107">its costs</COREF> down in other areas, too. 
 Two years ago, <COREF ID="109">Mr. Dabah</COREF> shifted the responsibility for <COREF ID="110">the company</COREF>'s extensive print and television advertising to an in-house staff, enabling <COREF ID="111">Gitano</COREF> to get more mileage from <COREF ID="112">its</COREF> annual $15 million advertising budget. 


 <COREF ID="113">Gitano</COREF> has pulled off a clever illusion with its advertising. 
 <COREF ID="115">The campaign</COREF> gives <COREF ID="116">its clothes</COREF> a youthful and trendy image to lure <COREF ID="118">consumers</COREF> into the store. 
 But most of the clothes are actually cut to fit more mature bodies. 
 Most of <COREF ID="119">Gitano</COREF>'s fans are aging baby boomers, and some of <COREF ID="120">the brand</COREF>'s top sellers are maternity clothes and jeans for larger-sized women. 


 <COREF ID="121">Mr. Dabah</COREF>'s expansion plans include opening more <COREF ID="122">Gitano</COREF> retail outlets; there are currently 35. 
 Capitalizing on <COREF ID="123">Gitano</COREF>'s fashion image, <COREF ID="124">the company</COREF> also is rolling out a more expensive brand. 
 <COREF ID="125">Linea Gitano</COREF>, a new sportswear collection priced from $35 to $70, recently began selling exclusively in <COREF ID="126">department</COREF> and specialty stores. 


 But <COREF ID="127">Mr. Dabah</COREF> says <COREF ID="128">his</COREF> major focus will continue to be <COREF ID="129">the mass market</COREF>. 
 One area of <COREF ID="130">expansion</COREF> will be licensing agreements with other <COREF ID="131">apparel</COREF> companies. 
 This year, for example, Playtex Apparel Inc. licensed <COREF ID="132">the Gitano label</COREF> for a line of fashion bras in the $6 to $8 range to complement <COREF ID="133">Playtex</COREF>'s basic $15 bras. 
 "The sales have been tremendous so far," says Paul Mischinski, <COREF ID="134">marketing director</COREF> of Playtex's Gitano brand. 
 Says <COREF ID="137">Mr. Mischinski</COREF>: "<COREF ID="138">Gitano</COREF> has the total package-<COREF ID="139">customer</COREF> awareness, distribution and <COREF ID="140">fashion</COREF> leadership."

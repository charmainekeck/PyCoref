 <COREF ID="1">Nynex Corp.</COREF> and <COREF ID="2">its unions</COREF> haven't held <COREF ID="4">negotiations</COREF> <COREF ID="5">this week</COREF> and haven't scheduled <COREF ID="6">any further talks</COREF> on <COREF ID="7">a new contract to end a seven-week strike</COREF>. 


 A <COREF ID="8">company</COREF> spokesman said that <COREF ID="9">talks</COREF> with the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers broke down last weekend. 
 Since then, neither side has taken steps to resume <COREF ID="12">discussions</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="13">Union</COREF> spokesmen have said that <COREF ID="14">talks</COREF> are stalled over a <COREF ID="15">company</COREF> plan to shift some health-care costs to employees. 


 The <COREF ID="16">CWA</COREF> represents about 40,000 <COREF ID="17">Nynex</COREF> employees while the <COREF ID="18">IBEW</COREF> represents 20,000. 


 In California, meanwhile, <COREF ID="19">CWA</COREF> members must vote by today on a tentative agreement between <COREF ID="20">union</COREF> and Pacific Telesis negotiators reached last month. 
 Officials at some <COREF ID="21">union</COREF> locals are recommending against the proposed contract, raising the possibility that <COREF ID="22">Pac Tel</COREF> and the <COREF ID="23">union</COREF> will have to renegotiate parts of <COREF ID="24">the agreement</COREF>.

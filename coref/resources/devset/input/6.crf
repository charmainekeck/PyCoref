 NBC to Put Contract Offer
Into Effect; Strike Possible

 <COREF ID="1">National Broadcasting Co.</COREF> told its technicians and news employees union that <COREF ID="3">the network</COREF> will put into effect next Monday <COREF ID="4">its latest contract offer</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="6">Union</COREF> leaders said the move probably means the union's 2,800 NBC members -- <COREF ID="9">about a third of the company's work force</COREF> -- will strike. 


 "It looks like <COREF ID="11">we</COREF>'re going to be there on the street, unless there is a miracle," said John Krieger, <COREF ID="12">a spokesman</COREF> for the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, which last struck NBC, a General Electric Co. unit, in 1976. 


 The possibility of <COREF ID="15">a strike</COREF> comes amid growing signs of a strike among members of the Directors Guild of America, whose talks with the three major networks on a contract to replace an agreement expiring June 30 appear to be stalling. 


 On Tuesday, a federal mediator brought <COREF ID="16">NBC</COREF> and <COREF ID="17">the union</COREF> together for the first time since <COREF ID="18">the union</COREF>'s four-year contract expired March 31. 
 Both sides were deadlocked. 
 Areas of dispute include use of temporary workers at <COREF ID="19">NBC</COREF>, the length of the new contract and use of non-network news services.

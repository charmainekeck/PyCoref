 The National Mediation Board is expected to release <COREF ID="1">Pan Am Corp.</COREF> and <COREF ID="2">its Teamsters union</COREF> from <COREF ID="77">their long-stalled contract negotiations</COREF>, throwing into question a wage-concession agreement. 


 The release means both sides will be asked to submit to arbitration; if one of the parties refuses, as is expected, a 30-day cooling off period will go into effect, after which <COREF ID="6">the Teamsters</COREF> are free to strike. 


 William Genoese, <COREF ID="7">head of the airline division of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters</COREF>, said <COREF ID="9">he</COREF> was "shocked and surprised" when <COREF ID="10">he</COREF> heard late Friday from negotiator Walter Wallace of <COREF ID="11">the board</COREF>'s plans to release <COREF ID="12">the parties</COREF> from <COREF ID="13">negotiations</COREF>. 


 At noon EST today, <COREF ID="14">the mediation board</COREF> is expected to ask <COREF ID="15">both parties</COREF> to submit to <COREF ID="16">arbitration</COREF>. 


 As previously reported, <COREF ID="17">Pan Am</COREF> had asked <COREF ID="18">the National Mediation Board</COREF> to declare an impasse in <COREF ID="19">the talks</COREF> in late December. 
 But <COREF ID="20">Pan Am</COREF>, sensing progress in <COREF ID="21">its</COREF> recent negotiations with the unions, asked <COREF ID="22">the board</COREF> to delay acting on <COREF ID="23">the company</COREF>'s request, a source close to <COREF ID="24">the board</COREF> said. 


 Also as previously reported, <COREF ID="25">Pan Am</COREF> said last week <COREF ID="26">it</COREF> would make "changes in senior management" in exchange for labor-cost concessions of $180 million a year for three years from the unions of its Pan American World Airways unit. 
 <COREF ID="29">The agreement</COREF> was reached by a coalition of four of Pan Am's five unions; <COREF ID="31">the Teamsters union</COREF> was part of <COREF ID="32">that coalition</COREF> -- but has made it clear recently <COREF ID="33">it</COREF> did not necessarily go along with <COREF ID="34">the agreement</COREF>. 


 For the past year, <COREF ID="35">the coalition</COREF> has been trying to force a restructuring of <COREF ID="36">Pan Am</COREF> and <COREF ID="37">a change in top management</COREF>. 
 Negotiations have been held with William T. Coleman, <COREF ID="39">a Pan Am director and Washington attorney</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="42">Pan Am</COREF>'s directors are scheduled to meet tomorrow, <COREF ID="43">the deadline set for the union's wage-concession agreement</COREF>. 
 It wasn't immediately clear if <COREF ID="46">the Teamsters</COREF>'s release might jeopardize <COREF ID="47">that agreement</COREF>. 


 Last Saturday, <COREF ID="48">Mr. Genoese</COREF> said <COREF ID="49">he</COREF> sent a telegram to Mr. Coleman to announce that <COREF ID="51">the Teamsters</COREF> plan to end <COREF ID="52">their talks with the company</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="55">Mr. Genoese</COREF> said <COREF ID="56">he</COREF> had a "cordial" initial meeting with Mr. Coleman last Thursday, but made no commitment to provide concessions. 


 "<COREF ID="58">That meeting</COREF> made it clear to <COREF ID="59">Mr. Coleman</COREF> that <COREF ID="60">the Teamsters</COREF> and <COREF ID="61">Pan Am</COREF> are still deadlocked," one source close to <COREF ID="62">the negotiations</COREF> said. 


 "As far as <COREF ID="63">we</COREF>'re concerned, <COREF ID="64">the company</COREF> triggered this," <COREF ID="65">Mr. Genoese</COREF> said. 
 "<COREF ID="66">We</COREF>'re not negotiating any more with <COREF ID="67">Pan Am</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="68">We</COREF>'re in strike procedure now." 
 <COREF ID="69">The union</COREF> has already indicated <COREF ID="70">it</COREF> would not be willing to submit to <COREF ID="71">arbitration</COREF>. 


 A <COREF ID="72">Pan Am</COREF> spokesman declined to comment. 


 <COREF ID="73">The Teamsters</COREF>, which represent about 4,500 ticket agents, reservation agents and clerical workers, have been working under a contract that was negotiated in 1978 and scheduled to be renegotiated in 1981. 
 <COREF ID="74">The federal mediation board</COREF> has rejected several earlier requests by <COREF ID="75">the union</COREF> to declare <COREF ID="76">the negotiations</COREF> deadlocked. 


 Meanwhile, Pan Am's pilots union said <COREF ID="78">it</COREF> is preparing to sign an agreement to deliver concessions to the company <COREF ID="81">today</COREF>. 
 A pilot's union spokesman said the leaders plan to take <COREF ID="83">the agreement</COREF> to <COREF ID="84">their</COREF> membership for ratification. 
 <COREF ID="85">He</COREF> said <COREF ID="86">he</COREF> didn't know how <COREF ID="87">the Teamsters</COREF> action would affect <COREF ID="88">the union's agreement with the company</COREF>.

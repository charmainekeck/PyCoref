 NEW YORK  


 <COREF ID="1">A federal mediator</COREF> is trying to reconcile the <COREF ID="2">New York Stock Exchange</COREF> and about 1,300 of its <COREF ID="3">clerical and operations staff members</COREF>, whose <COREF ID="4">union</COREF> contract expired Saturday night. 


 <COREF ID="5">The mediator</COREF> has imposed a news blackout on the two sides, so a Big Board spokesman couldn't comment on the <COREF ID="7">talks</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="8">The spokesman</COREF> did say that <COREF ID="9">the exchange</COREF> would be able to function normally in the event of a walkout. 


 <COREF ID="10">The workers</COREF>, <COREF ID="11">members of the Office and Professional Employees International Union Local 153</COREF>, work for <COREF ID="12">the exchange</COREF>; for Securities Industry Automation Corp., which operates <COREF ID="13">the exchange</COREF>'s computers and of which <COREF ID="14">the Big Board</COREF> owns two-thirds; and for the New York Futures Exchange, <COREF ID="15">a unit of the Big Board</COREF>. 


 Officials at <COREF ID="17">the union</COREF> and the <COREF ID="18">Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service</COREF> couldn't be reached for comment. 


 When <COREF ID="19">the union</COREF>'s previous contract expired in October 1984, <COREF ID="20">the union</COREF> kept working for eight months without a contract until an agreement was reached in June 1985.

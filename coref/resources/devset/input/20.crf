 OPEC Appears to Back Off a Price War As Output Sags, Quota Violator Reforms

 <COREF ID="2">The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</COREF> appears to be pulling back from the brink of <COREF ID="3">a possible price war</COREF>. 


 After recent major price declines because of a sharp rise in OPEC production, <COREF ID="7">total cartel output</COREF> has now dropped as much as one million barrels a day -- from the year's peak of 20 million barrels a day early this month. 
 And there are new indications that even <COREF ID="10">the United Arab Emirates</COREF>, <COREF ID="11">OPEC's most notable quota violator</COREF>, might soon cut its own output below a targeted 1.5 million barrels a day because of pressure from others in <COREF ID="15">the cartel</COREF>, including Saudi Arabia. 


 <COREF ID="16">The Emirates</COREF> aren't making any promises publicly. 
 But its government did offer conciliatory gestures to OPEC yesterday. 


 <COREF ID="19">The gestures</COREF> followed the arrival in Abu Dhabi of OPEC's new secretary-general, <COREF ID="21">Subroto</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="22">Mr. Subroto</COREF> delivered a letter to Sheik Zayed Al Nahyyan, <COREF ID="23">the Emirates' ruler</COREF>, from Rilwanu Lukman, <COREF ID="25">Nigeria's oil minister and OPEC's president</COREF>, voicing concern over <COREF ID="29">the Emirates</COREF>' recent renunciation of its assigned quota of 948,000 barrels a day. 


 The chief conciliatory note at the round of talks with Mr. Subroto came from <COREF ID="33">Sheik Zayed</COREF>, who "reaffirmed" the Emirates' support for OPEC's "unity and cohesion." 
 According to the Emirates' official news agency, <COREF ID="37">the ruler</COREF> also noted that <COREF ID="38">his country</COREF> "has always been at the forefront for boosting <COREF ID="40">OPEC</COREF> decisions and supporting the stability of the market." 


 The <COREF ID="41">news agency</COREF> report didn't mention <COREF ID="42">the Emirates' production level</COREF>. 
 But senior oil officials in <COREF ID="45">the Emirates</COREF> were quoted by Dow Jones International Petroleum Report <COREF ID="46">yesterday</COREF> as saying that while <COREF ID="47">the government</COREF> isn't backing down on <COREF ID="48">its</COREF> demand for a higher <COREF ID="49">OPEC</COREF> quota, <COREF ID="50">current production</COREF> is well under <COREF ID="51">the target</COREF>. 


 Industry estimates generally place <COREF ID="52">the Emirates' current production</COREF> at between 1.2 million and 1.5 million barrels <COREF ID="54">a day</COREF>. 
 Until recently, such excess output by the Emirates would have been ignored. 
 But <COREF ID="56">it</COREF> became an issue for <COREF ID="57">OPEC</COREF> -- as well as for the world oil markets -- last month, when Emirates' officials went public with <COREF ID="60">their</COREF> intent to renounce <COREF ID="61">their quota</COREF>. 


 That not only focused new attention on <COREF ID="63">OPEC output</COREF>, which had begun climbing in late June, as previously reported, but <COREF ID="65">it</COREF> also raised concern among other exporters. 


 With Iraq also excluded from <COREF ID="66">the system</COREF> as a result of fallout from <COREF ID="67">its</COREF> war with Iran, "<COREF ID="68">they</COREF> are afraid that if <COREF ID="69">the UAE</COREF> continues outside there will be no control over <COREF ID="70">the others</COREF>," said Bahman Karbassioun, a Vienna-based consultant on <COREF ID="71">OPEC</COREF> affairs. 


 In addition to <COREF ID="72">Mr. Subroto</COREF>'s visit to <COREF ID="73">Abu Dhabi</COREF>, <COREF ID="74">OPEC</COREF>'s <COREF ID="75">price</COREF>-monitoring committee of five leading <COREF ID="76">oil</COREF> ministers also is tentatively scheduled to meet next Wednesday in Lausanne, Switzerland, to address the problem of <COREF ID="77">the Emirates</COREF>' unilateral <COREF ID="78">quota</COREF> decision, and to review <COREF ID="79">world oil prices</COREF>. 
 But <COREF ID="81">OPEC</COREF>'s headquarters <COREF ID="82">yesterday</COREF> still declined to confirm details of the meeting. 
 "<COREF ID="83">It</COREF>'s tentative because <COREF ID="84">it</COREF> depends on the outcome of <COREF ID="85">the talks in the UAE</COREF>," said an <COREF ID="87">OPEC</COREF> spokesman. 


 Meanwhile, <COREF ID="88">total OPEC output</COREF> has dropped as much as 5% after <COREF ID="90">the recent run-up</COREF> -- with <COREF ID="91">Saudi Arabia</COREF>, <COREF ID="92">the cartel's biggest producer</COREF>, pacing the declines. 
 PetroLogistics Ltd., a Geneva-based consulting firm that closely monitors <COREF ID="94">OPEC output</COREF>, estimates production for July had averaged just over 19 million barrels a day after reaching <COREF ID="97">20 million barrels a day in the first week of the month</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="100">That</COREF>'s in line with demand for <COREF ID="101">OPEC</COREF> oil for the second half, according to a current report on <COREF ID="102">world oil markets</COREF> by Charles L. McSpadden, <COREF ID="104">manager of petroleum analysis</COREF>, and Antonio M. Szabo, <COREF ID="106">manager of petroleum planning</COREF>, at Bonner @amp; Moore Market Consultants, Houston. 
 "<COREF ID="108">The 19 million barrels a day</COREF> is in <COREF ID="110">OPEC</COREF>'s comfort zone," said <COREF ID="111">Mr. Szabo</COREF>.

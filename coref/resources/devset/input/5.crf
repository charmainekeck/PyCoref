Minnesota Isn't 'Bashing' Mediation

 I was pleased to see your May 5 article, "Farm-Debt Mediation Catches On in Iowa." 
 <COREF ID="5">Farm-debt mediation</COREF> is, indeed, a Farm Belt success story in the midst of the most devastating crash in the farm economy since the Great Depression. 


 <COREF ID="10">I</COREF> am compelled, however, to comment on <COREF ID="11">your</COREF> evaluation of Minnesota's mediation program. 
 While <COREF ID="14">Minnesota's program</COREF> has met some resistance from creditors, <COREF ID="16">it</COREF> nonetheless has been a solid success. 
 As of April 24, there were 3,864 mediations that either have been completed or were in progress. 
 Of the 2,939 completed mediations, 1,393 -- or 46% -- resulted in an agreement. 
 It is clear from these figures that despite the naysayers, <COREF ID="17">Minnesota mediation</COREF> works. 
 <COREF ID="19">It</COREF> helps keep farmers on the land and <COREF ID="20">creditors</COREF> in business. 
 Most important, as the University of Minnesota found when <COREF ID="21">it</COREF> evaluated <COREF ID="22">the program</COREF> last winter, <COREF ID="23">mediation</COREF> has reduced significantly the threat of violence in rural areas. 


 Moreover, recent data indicate that <COREF ID="24">mediation</COREF> is a viable alternative to bankruptcy. 
 An analysis completed by the Center for Rural Affairs indicates that states with <COREF ID="25">mediation</COREF> have had proportionately fewer Chapter 12 bankruptcy filings. 
 Of the six Midwestern states surveyed, <COREF ID="26">Minnesota</COREF> had the fewest <COREF ID="27">Chapter 12</COREF> filings per 1,000 farmers. 


 As <COREF ID="28">your article</COREF> notes, the Minnesota Legislature is considering various amendments to the Mediation Act. 
 However, <COREF ID="30">the proposed amendments</COREF> are not the result of "<COREF ID="31">mediation</COREF>-bashing," as <COREF ID="32">the article</COREF> suggests. 
 Rather, <COREF ID="33">they</COREF> are the result of a growing consensus that <COREF ID="34">mediation</COREF> works and should be improved in order to ensure <COREF ID="35">it</COREF> works even better. 


 The program's record speaks for <COREF ID="37">itself</COREF>. 
 <COREF ID="38">It</COREF> demonstrates that <COREF ID="39">farmers</COREF> and lenders can work together to solve the challenge created by <COREF ID="40">the continuing crisis</COREF> in our nation's rural economy.

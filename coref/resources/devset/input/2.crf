 Amr corp.'s <COREF ID="5">American Airlines unit</COREF> said <COREF ID="6">it</COREF> has called for <COREF ID="7">federal mediation</COREF> in its contract talks with unions representing its pilots and flight attendants. 


 A spokesman for <COREF ID="14">the company</COREF> said <COREF ID="15">American</COREF> officials "felt talks had reached a point where <COREF ID="17">mediation</COREF> would be helpful." 
 Negotiations with <COREF ID="18">the pilots</COREF> have been going on for 11 months; talks with <COREF ID="19">flight attendants</COREF> began six months ago. 


 The president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents American's more than 10,000 flight attendants, called the request for mediation "premature" and characterized <COREF ID="24">it</COREF> as a bargaining tactic that could lead to a lockout. 
 <COREF ID="25">Patt gibbs</COREF>, <COREF ID="26">president of the association</COREF>, said talks with the company seemed to be progressing well and <COREF ID="29">the call for mediation</COREF> came as a surprise. 


 The major outstanding issue in the negotiations with the flight attendants is <COREF ID="33">a two-tier wage scale</COREF>, in which recent employees' salaries increase on a different scale than the salaries of employees who have worked at <COREF ID="34">american</COREF> for a longer time. 
 The union wants to narrow the differences between the new scale and the old one. 


 <COREF ID="36">The company</COREF> declined to comment on <COREF ID="37">the negotiations</COREF> or the outstanding issues. 
 Representatives for the 5,400-member Allied Pilots Association didn't return phone calls. 


 Under the Federal Railway Labor Act, if the mediator fails to bring the two sides together and <COREF ID="38">the two sides</COREF> don't agree to binding arbitration, a 30-day cooling-off period follows. 
 After <COREF ID="39">that</COREF>, the union can strike or <COREF ID="40">the company</COREF> can lock <COREF ID="41">the union</COREF> out. 


 <COREF ID="42">Ms. Gibbs</COREF> said that in response to <COREF ID="43">the company</COREF>'s move, <COREF ID="44">her union</COREF> will be "escalating" <COREF ID="46">its</COREF> "corporate campaign" against <COREF ID="47">American</COREF> over the next couple of months. 
 In a corporate campaign, a union tries to get a company's financiers, investors, directors and other financial partners to pressure <COREF ID="48">the company</COREF> to meet <COREF ID="49">union</COREF> demands. 


 <COREF ID="50">A corporate campaign</COREF>, <COREF ID="51">she</COREF> said, appeals to <COREF ID="52">her members</COREF> because "<COREF ID="54">it</COREF> is a nice, clean way to take a job action, and <COREF ID="55">our women</COREF> are hired to be nice." <COREF ID="56">the union</COREF> has decided not to strike, <COREF ID="57">she</COREF> said. 


 <COREF ID="58">The union</COREF> has hired a number of professional consultants in <COREF ID="59">its</COREF> battle with <COREF ID="60">the company</COREF>, including Ray Rogers of Corporate Campaign Inc., <COREF ID="61">the New York labor consultant</COREF> who developed the strategy at Geo. A. Hormel @amp; Co.'s Austin, Minn., meatpacking plant last year. 
 That campaign, which included a strike, faltered when <COREF ID="63">the company</COREF> hired new workers and the International Meatpacking Union wrested control of the local union from <COREF ID="64">Rogers</COREF>' supporters.

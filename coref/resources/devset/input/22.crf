 Your Money Matters: Massachusetts Says Brokers Can't Insist on Arbitration 
 Christi Harlan (WSJ Staff) 
 
 SCR 


 <COREF ID="1">Massachusetts</COREF>, in a move that may be repeated in a number of states, will eliminate mandatory arbitration in disputes between <COREF ID="2">brokers</COREF> and investors. 


 A new regulation, scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, will require <COREF ID="3">brokers</COREF> to advise <COREF ID="4">customers</COREF> of <COREF ID="5">their</COREF> constitutional right to take disputes to court. 
 And <COREF ID="6">brokers</COREF> can't refuse to do business with an <COREF ID="7">investor</COREF> who declines to sign a statement agreeing to settle disputes through arbitration. 


 The securities industry has favored <COREF ID="9">arbitration</COREF> because <COREF ID="10">it</COREF> keeps <COREF ID="11">brokers</COREF> and dealers out of <COREF ID="12">court</COREF>. 
 But consumer advocates say <COREF ID="13">customers</COREF> sometimes unwittingly sign away <COREF ID="14">their</COREF> right to sue. 


 "<COREF ID="15">We</COREF> don't necessarily have a beef with <COREF ID="16">the arbitration process</COREF>," says Martin Meehan, <COREF ID="17">deputy secretary</COREF> of state in Massachusetts. 
 "<COREF ID="19">We</COREF> just think the <COREF ID="20">consumers</COREF> ought to have a choice." 


 <COREF ID="21">Massachusetts</COREF> is the first of what may be several states to bar <COREF ID="22">mandatory arbitration</COREF>. 
 According to a survey by the North American Securities Administrators Association, which comprises securities regulators in the 50 states, a dozen or more states in the next six months expect to consider rules banning <COREF ID="23">forced arbitration</COREF>. 


 The securities administrators have a laundry list of complaints against <COREF ID="24">mandatory arbitration</COREF>. 
 "The panels (of arbitrators) are stacked in favor of <COREF ID="25">the industry</COREF>, the proceedings are not public and there are no written decisions," says Scott Stapf, <COREF ID="26">director</COREF> of consumer education for the administrators' association. 


 <COREF ID="29">Mandatory arbitration agreements</COREF> have proliferated since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 1987 that <COREF ID="31">brokers</COREF> could require that <COREF ID="32">their customers</COREF> sign <COREF ID="34">them</COREF>. 
 The most common agreements require <COREF ID="35">customers</COREF> who believe <COREF ID="36">their brokers</COREF> have defrauded <COREF ID="38">them</COREF> to submit to <COREF ID="39">arbitration</COREF> instead of filing a lawsuit. 
 Because of rules requiring abbreviated evidence and arguments, <COREF ID="40">arbitration</COREF> is generally faster than going to <COREF ID="41">court</COREF>. 
 And the losing side has no route for appeal -- the arbitrator's decision is final. 


 The popularity of the <COREF ID="42">agreements</COREF> among <COREF ID="43">brokers</COREF> was cemented after the October market crash. 
 As a result of previously signed agreements, hundreds of <COREF ID="44">investors</COREF> were forced to file arbitration claims, and <COREF ID="45">brokers</COREF> avoided time-consuming and expensive lawsuits. 
 But <COREF ID="46">the securities administrators' association</COREF> said most of the 15,000 calls to its post-crash hotline were complaints about <COREF ID="48">forced arbitration</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="49">Mandatory arbitration agreements</COREF> are most commonly required of <COREF ID="51">customers</COREF> buying on margin or dealing in options. 
 But <COREF ID="52">the state securities regulators</COREF> want to make sure that the practice doesn't spread to the smaller, less risky cash <COREF ID="53">customers</COREF>, hence <COREF ID="54">the Massachusetts regulation</COREF>. 


 The Securities Industry Association, whose representatives testified against <COREF ID="56">the Massachusetts regulation</COREF> during public hearings in July, already is prepared to challenge <COREF ID="58">the regulation</COREF> in <COREF ID="59">court</COREF>. 


 "What <COREF ID="60">they</COREF>'re doing is clearly unconstitutional," says Bill Fitzpatrick, <COREF ID="61">general counsel</COREF> for the SIA. 
 "There will be a legal challenge." 
 <COREF ID="63">Mr. Fitzpatrick</COREF> says <COREF ID="64">the Supreme Court</COREF> ruled in <COREF ID="65">June 1987</COREF> that states are pre-empted from taking any action against <COREF ID="66">arbitration</COREF> in securities cases. 


 James C. Meyer, <COREF ID="67">president of the North American Securities Administrators Association</COREF>, disagrees. 
 The Supreme Court ruling, <COREF ID="69">he</COREF> says, said only that <COREF ID="70">brokers</COREF> can require <COREF ID="71">customers</COREF> to sign <COREF ID="72">arbitration agreements</COREF>. 
 "<COREF ID="73">It</COREF> doesn't say <COREF ID="74">arbitration agreements</COREF> are OK and everyone should sign on," <COREF ID="75">Mr. Meyer</COREF> says.

 <COREF ID="3">Boeing Co.</COREF> said <COREF ID="4">it</COREF> agreed to pay <COREF ID="5">$200,000</COREF> to settle seven civil cases brought by the Federal Aviation Administration in connection with the miswiring of fire-protection systems on its jetliners. 


 <COREF ID="10">The fine</COREF> is <COREF ID="11">the biggest ever collected from Boeing and perhaps from any airplane maker</COREF>. 


 In July, <COREF ID="13">the FAA</COREF> proposed <COREF ID="14">a $200,000 penalty</COREF> in one of the cases in which Boeing allegedly notified the agency months after it uncovered wiring problems on two aircraft. 
 Federal regulations require that defects be reported within 24 hours of <COREF ID="18">their</COREF> discovery. 


 But <COREF ID="19">the FAA</COREF> and <COREF ID="20">Boeing</COREF> worked out a deal in which six other cases related to miswiring were included as part of a comprehensive settlement. 


 <COREF ID="22">The FAA</COREF> said <COREF ID="23">the agreement</COREF> specifies a number of corrective actions and design changes to be made by <COREF ID="24">Boeing</COREF> "to ensure <COREF ID="25">the miswiring conditions that are the subject of these cases</COREF> will not be repeated." 
 The fire-extinguishing systems have never failed in service. 


 In addition, <COREF ID="29">the FAA</COREF> said, <COREF ID="30">Boeing</COREF> has agreed to implement written procedures "to ensure appropriate and timely reporting of <COREF ID="31">all defects" that could hurt safety</COREF>.

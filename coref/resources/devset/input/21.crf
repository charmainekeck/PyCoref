 LABOR 
 PUL 
 VANCOUVER, British Columbia  


 A group of <COREF ID="1">large British Columbia forest products companies</COREF> has reached a tentative, <COREF ID="2">three-year labor contract</COREF> with about 18,000 members of the IWA-Canada union, a spokesman for <COREF ID="5">the companies</COREF> said. 


 <COREF ID="6">The settlement</COREF> involves <COREF ID="7">about 80 companies</COREF>, including Vancouver-based MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. and other large integrated forest products concerns with operations on the coast of British Columbia. 
 <COREF ID="8">The companies</COREF> negotiate jointly through a bargaining agent called <COREF ID="9">Forest Industrial Relations Ltd.</COREF> 


 A spokesman for <COREF ID="10">the bargaining agent</COREF> said <COREF ID="11">the settlement</COREF> is retroactive to June 15 and provides for a pay increase of 85 Canadian cents (<COREF ID="12">70.2 US cents</COREF>) in the first year and 5.5% in each of the second and third years, on a base rate of about 14.80 Canadian dollars (US$12.23) an hour. 


 <COREF ID="15">The pay terms</COREF> are similar to <COREF ID="17">those</COREF> accepted recently by members of two pulp and paper unions in British Columbia, the spokesman said. 
 <COREF ID="18">The IWA-Canada settlement</COREF> involves <COREF ID="20">workers in sawmills, logging operations and wood manufacturing</COREF>, and <COREF ID="21">the contract</COREF> remains subject to ratification by <COREF ID="22">the union members</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="23">The union</COREF> is still negotiating with two smaller regional employer bargaining groups in the interior of British Columbia. 
 The continuing negotiations affect about 8,000 to 10,000 union members.

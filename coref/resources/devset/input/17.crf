 <COREF ID="2">President Reagan</COREF> acknowledged that there is little chance <COREF ID="3">he</COREF> and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will sign <COREF ID="4">a strategic arms agreement</COREF> at <COREF ID="26">their summit</COREF> in Moscow later this month. 


 In answering questions from members of the National Strategy Forum <COREF ID="7">here</COREF>, <COREF ID="8">Mr. Reagan</COREF> said it is "doubtful" that a strategic arms reduction, or START, treaty could be wrapped up in time. 
 Administration aides have been saying for weeks that there are far too many disagreements remaining for <COREF ID="11">a treaty</COREF> to be wrapped up, but <COREF ID="12">Mr. Reagan</COREF>'s remarks represented <COREF ID="13">his</COREF> bluntest public assessment so far. 


 <COREF ID="14">Mr. Reagan</COREF> said that both <COREF ID="15">he</COREF> and <COREF ID="16">Mr. Gorbachev</COREF> hope that an agreement eliminating intermediate-range nuclear missiles, signed at a summit meeting in Washington last December, will be ratified by the Senate in time for <COREF ID="19">the Moscow summit</COREF>. 
 But then <COREF ID="21">he</COREF> added: "Our desire that <COREF ID="23">we</COREF> would be able to sign <COREF ID="24">a START treaty</COREF> at <COREF ID="25">this Moscow summit</COREF>, as <COREF ID="27">we</COREF> did <COREF ID="28">the other one at the Washington summit</COREF>, may not happen." 


 <COREF ID="31">Mr. Reagan</COREF> insisted that if such a treaty is ever completed, <COREF ID="32">it</COREF> would have to produce "parity" in U.S. and Soviet strategic arsenals.

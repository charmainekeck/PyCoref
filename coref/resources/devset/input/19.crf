 Early Aluminum Talks Set By Steel Union, 2 Firms 
 
 LABOR AA RLM 
 MIN 
 ST. LOUIS  


 <COREF ID="2">The United Steelworkers union</COREF> agreed yesterday to open <COREF ID="3">early contract talks</COREF> Aug. 9 with <COREF ID="4">the nation's two biggest aluminum makers</COREF>. 


 Local presidents, meeting <COREF ID="6">here</COREF>, voted to begin <COREF ID="7">the early bargaining</COREF> in an effort to roll back concessions granted in 1986. 
 The current pacts with Aluminum Co. of America and Reynolds Metals Co. expire next May 31, and any new accord would supersede that one. 


 "When we negotiated <COREF ID="10">the current contracts</COREF> in <COREF ID="11">1986</COREF>, our members made sacrifices to help the companies over hard times," said George Becker, the union's chief negotiator. 


 Since <COREF ID="16">then</COREF>, though, the aluminum industry has staged a strong recovery, and <COREF ID="18">Mr. Becker</COREF> said <COREF ID="19">union members</COREF> expect to "share in <COREF ID="21">those gains</COREF> and recover <COREF ID="22">the sacrifices they made</COREF>." 
 Under normal circumstances, bargaining wouldn't have begun until next year. 


 Pittsburgh-based Alcoa and Reynolds, Richmond, Va., have agreed to <COREF ID="26">the early talks</COREF>. 
 The union's action follows a similar decision Friday by the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers union, which bargains in concert with <COREF ID="28">the Steelworkers</COREF>. 


 Combined, the two unions represent about 21,000 <COREF ID="29">Alcoa</COREF> and <COREF ID="30">Reynolds</COREF> employees.

 <COREF ID="1">Communications Satellite Corp., Washington</COREF>, said <COREF ID="3">it</COREF> submitted to the Federal Communications Commission a proposal to reduce by 50% rates for certain international telecommunication services. 


 In exchange for the reductions, customers such as American Telephone @amp; Telegraph Co. would have to commit themselves to using one of two new types of digital satellite services for a 10-year period, <COREF ID="4">Comsat</COREF> said. 


 The proposal is part of a multi-year agreement between <COREF ID="5">Comsat</COREF> and <COREF ID="6">AT@amp;T</COREF> that guarantees <COREF ID="7">Comsat</COREF> a portion of <COREF ID="8">the telephone company</COREF>'s international business in the face of growing competition from fiber-optic cables. 


 <COREF ID="9">Comsat</COREF> said <COREF ID="10">AT@amp;T</COREF> and other customers would be able to convert gradually to <COREF ID="11">the new digital service</COREF> beginning next year, and that by 1994, as much as 83% of a customer's international circuits could qualify for <COREF ID="12">the price reductions</COREF>. 


 <COREF ID="13">Digital service</COREF> allows telecommunications customers to subdivide satellite circuits to handle more than one message at a time, <COREF ID="14">Comsat</COREF> said.

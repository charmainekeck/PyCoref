Minnesota Isn't 'Bashing' Mediation
         
                        
                                                                      


 I was pleased to see your May 5 article, "Farm-Debt Mediation Catches On in Iowa." 
 Farm-debt mediation is, indeed, a Farm Belt success story in the midst of the most devastating crash in the farm economy since the Great Depression. 


 I am compelled, however, to comment on your evaluation of Minnesota's mediation program. 
 While Minnesota's program has met some resistance from creditors, it nonetheless has been a solid success. 
 As of April 24, there were 3,864 mediations that either have been completed or were in progress. 
 Of the 2,939 completed mediations, 1,393 -- or 46% -- resulted in an agreement. 
 It is clear from these figures that despite the naysayers, Minnesota mediation works. 
 It helps keep farmers on the land and creditors in business. 
 Most important, as the University of Minnesota found when it evaluated the program last winter, mediation has reduced significantly the threat of violence in rural areas. 


 Moreover, recent data indicate that mediation is a viable alternative to bankruptcy. 
 An analysis completed by the Center for Rural Affairs indicates that states with mediation have had proportionately fewer Chapter 12 bankruptcy filings. 
 Of the six Midwestern states surveyed, Minnesota had the fewest Chapter 12 filings per 1,000 farmers. 


 As your article notes, the Minnesota Legislature is considering various amendments to the Mediation Act. 
 However, the proposed amendments are not the result of "mediation-bashing," as the article suggests. 
 Rather, they are the result of a growing consensus that mediation works and should be improved in order to ensure it works even better. 


 The program's record speaks for itself. 
 It demonstrates that farmers and lenders can work together to solve the challenge created by the continuing crisis in our nation's rural economy.

 ST. LOUIS  


 The United Steelworkers union agreed yesterday to open early contract talks Aug. 9 with the nation's two biggest aluminum makers. 


 Local presidents, meeting here, voted to begin the early bargaining in an effort to roll back concessions granted in 1986. 
 The current pacts with Aluminum Co. of America and Reynolds Metals Co. expire next May 31, and any new accord would supersede that one. 


 "When we negotiated the current contracts in 1986, our members made sacrifices to help the companies over hard times," said George Becker, the union's chief negotiator. 


 Since then, though, the aluminum industry has staged a strong recovery, and Mr. Becker said union members expect to "share in those gains and recover the sacrifices they made." 
 Under normal circumstances, bargaining wouldn't have begun until next year. 


 Pittsburgh-based Alcoa and Reynolds, Richmond, Va., have agreed to the early talks. 
 The union's action follows a similar decision Friday by the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers union, which bargains in concert with the Steelworkers. 


 Combined, the two unions represent about 21,000 Alcoa and Reynolds employees.

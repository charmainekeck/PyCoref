 Olin Corp. and a subsidiary of SGS Thomson Microelectronics Group signed a "strategic alliance" agreement that calls for a sharing of microchip-manufacturing technology. 


 A spokesman for Olin, based in Stamford, Conn., said the company would share chemicals, metals and microchip interconnection, or packaging, technology with Innovative Silicon Technology, the SGS-Thomson unit. 
 The Italian microchip maker, meanwhile, would give Olin access to its production processes. 


 Separately, Olin said it expects 1988 net income to rise to $4.60 a share from $3.32 a share last year. 


 At an analysts' meeting yesterday John W. Johnstone Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the company has the potential to increase earnings to $6 a share in 1989. 
 He attributed the expected improvement to the company's recent restructuring.

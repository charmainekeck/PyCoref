Into Effect; Strike Possible
         
                        
          
 NEW YORK  


 National Broadcasting Co. told its technicians and news employees union that the network will put into effect next Monday its latest contract offer. 
 Union leaders said the move probably means the union's 2,800 NBC members -- about a third of the company's work force -- will strike. 


 "It looks like we're going to be there on the street, unless there is a miracle," said John Krieger, a spokesman for the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, which last struck NBC, a General Electric Co. unit, in 1976. 


 The possibility of a strike comes amid growing signs of a strike among members of the Directors Guild of America, whose talks with the three major networks on a contract to replace an agreement expiring June 30 appear to be stalling. 


 On Tuesday, a federal mediator brought NBC and the union together for the first time since the union's four-year contract expired March 31. 
 Both sides were deadlocked. 
 Areas of dispute include use of temporary workers at NBC, the length of the new contract and use of non-network news services.

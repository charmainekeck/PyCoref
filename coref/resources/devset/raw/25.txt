 Eastern Pilots Win Round
@  In Battle Over Back Pay 
          
                         
           
                                   
 NEW YORK  


 Eastern Airlines pilots won a round in bankruptcy court that they say could bring them as much as $250 million in back pay, but an arbitrator must decide how much -- if anything -- they are owed. 


 The decision by Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland in New York will allow the Air Line Pilots Association to go forward with a claim that a "pay parity" clause in their contract was triggered when another Eastern union received a pay raise. 


 All legal proceedings against Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., were put on hold when Eastern filed for bankruptcy-law protection March 9. 
 But Judge Lifland lifted that stay to let the three-year-old back-pay claim go to arbitration, provided that process is swift. 
 If it doesn't go quickly enough, the judge said he may invoke a provision of the bankruptcy code that would let him estimate what pilots are owed. 
 The arbitration is scheduled to begin Aug. 9. 


 At issue is a three-year-old effort by the pilots to prove they had a valid contract in 1986, and that Eastern violated a clause in it that would give them raises if any other group got raises. 
 Shortly after Texas Air took over Eastern, management supervisors for the machinists' union received a 20% pay raise. 


 The pilots have won two rounds of this battle in federal court, with federal district court and an appeals court deciding that the pilots' contract was valid. 
 Neither court, however, ruled on the merits of their claim.

 The rise in labor costs and wage settlements, which has been narrowing for most of the decade, leveled off last year, the Labor Department said. 


 Total compensation costs in private industry, including pay and benefits, rose 3.3% last year after a 3.2% increase in 1986, the department said. 
 The increase in these costs had been getting smaller each year since 1981, when they rose 9.8%, the same as in 1980. 


 Meanwhile, collective bargaining agreements reached last year called for an average 2.2% wage increase in the first year of the contract and 2.1% annually over the life of the pact. 
 The industries surveyed agreed to the same percentage pay raises when they last reached contract accords, the department said. 
 Officials said it's the first time since 1982 that current contract settlements didn't provide lower average wage adjustments than the bargaining agreements they replaced. 


 The wage agreements reached last year also were higher than the average pay rises bargained in 1986, when a 1.2% increase in the first contract year and a 1.8% annual increase during the life of the settlements were the smallest increases recorded during the 20 years the Labor Department has collected the statistics. 
 Department officials said this year's higher wage increases don't necessarily indicate a trend. 


 A tighter labor market in the services sector may be part of the reason the compensation increases have leveled off, officials said. 
 A tighter labor market would allow employees to demand higher pay and benefits. 


 In its report on major collective bargaining agreements, the department said that the average increase was reduced by lump-sum payments, which are one-time payments often made upon a contract's ratification. 
 The payments often are provided instead of wage increases, but they aren't included in wages and aren't used as a base for future increases. 
 About half of the workers covered by big labor contracts last year received these payments. 


 Better-than-average wage settlements for construction industry workers -- specifically those in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions -- were largely responsible for stopping the narrowing trend. 
 Construction pacts settled in 1987 averaged 2.9% increases in the first contract year and 3.1% annually. 
 All other industries surveyed last year, including the automobile, food store and steel industries, averaged 2.1% increases in the first contract year and 1.9% annually. 


 About two million workers were covered by agreements reached last year.

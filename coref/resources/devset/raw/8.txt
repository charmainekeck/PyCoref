 Striking auto workers and Chrysler Corp.'s Canadian unit appeared to be making progress in negotiations yesterday, as the company said it planned to make a new contract offer by this morning. 


 Meanwhile, in Dearborn, Mich., Ford Motor Co. and the United Auto Workers union continued negotiations into the evening yesterday, but neither side would officially discuss progress. 


 Early in the day, bargaining committee members had reported to their union locals that a settlement was imminent. 
 Still, negotiations dragged on. 
 Late last night union officials were still hoping to announce a settlement by early this morning. 


 UAW President Owen Bieber was absent from the talks all day. 
 The 57-year-old union leader checked into Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit Tuesday night for testing because of abdominal pain, one source said. 
 The tests ruled out any heart problems, and Mr. Bieber was apparently in "good condition," the source said. 
 He added that Mr. Bieber's hospitalization doesn't affect the pace of negotiations. 
 A UAW spokesman would neither confirm nor deny the report. 


 In Toronto, Robert White, president of the Canadian Auto Workers union, said he expects the new offer from Chrysler Canada Ltd. to contain sweetened cost-of-living adjustments for pensioners. 


 The Canadian union has made inflation-indexed pension payments its top priority in the talks. 
 Mr. White said negotiators "unlocked the logjam on the main issue" after all-night meetings Tuesday and yesterday. 


 The union struck Chrysler Canada Tuesday after rejecting a company offer on pension adjustments. 
 The union said the size of the adjustments was inadequate. 


 But Chrysler Canada's chief negotiator, William Fisher, said yesterday that the two sides had reached "some understandings" on economic issues, including pensions. 
 "We have a good chance of wrapping something up by the end of the week," he said. 


 Mr. White allowed negotiations on local issues to resume yesterday. 
 About 200 local issues that remain unsettled had been suspended while the CAW and Chrysler grappled with the pension issue. 


 If a settlement comes today or tomorrow, Chrysler's 10,000 Canadian workers could vote on a contract this weekend, when the union has scheduled membership meetings for the striking workers. 
 Chrysler said its four Canadian plants could resume production Monday if a new pact is accepted. 


 A company spokesman said about 2,285 workers remain on layoff at two U.S. plants as a result of the Canadian strike. 
 As previously reported, Chrysler stopped output of Dodge Dynasty and Chrysler New Yorker cars yesterday at its Belvidere, Ill., plant because of a shortage of Canadian-made parts. 
 Some 1,700 of the plant's 2,900 hourly employees were laid off as a result. 


 Also, about 585 workers were laid off at a stamping plant near Detroit because the parts they make aren't needed in Canada during the strike. 
 That plant normally employs 2,800 hourly workers. 


 The CAW's contracts with Chrysler and the Canadian units of General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. expired Monday. 
 Talks with GM and Ford are on hold pending the outcome of the Chrysler talks. 


 In the Ford-UAW talks, the two parties turned to economics yesterday in addition to the job-security issue. 
 Sources said Ford expressed willingness to offer some sort of base-wage raise, or annual improvement factor, but it wasn't clear how much or for how many years. 
 In the previous contract, the company made lump-sum payments instead of base-wage raises in two of the three years. 
 It offered no base-wage raises in its initial proposal this year. 


 On the job-security issue, it is understood that Ford agreed not to lay off any workers during the life of the contract except during a major sales plunge. 
 The company also promised to replace half of all workers leaving the company. 
 At last report, the two sides were still haggling over details of the job-security plan, while also discussing the wage and benefit package. 


 The contract expired at midnight Monday, but the union, citing progress, agreed to an indefinite extension. 


 The UAW's contract with GM also expired Monday, but negotiations with the No. 1 auto maker were postponed pending a settlement with Ford. 
 Chrysler's U.S. contract doesn't expire until next year. 


 Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Chrysler closed at $42.25, down $1. 
 Ford closed at $104, down 62.5 cents.

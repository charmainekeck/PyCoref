 As senior director of UAL, and a member of the executive committee of its board, I am appalled at the inaccuracies and anti-management bias in the Journal's April 17 article about Richard Ferris, UAL's chief executive officer. 


 The UAL board is four-square behind Mr. Ferris, his management team and his long-range strategy of making United a more competitive airline by combining it with the premier hotel company and car rental company. 
 Contrary to what the Journal article suggests, board members have not been dissatisfied with the financial performance of Westin Hotels and Hertz. 


 Like Mr. Ferris, the directors have been dissatisfied with the earnings of United Airlines. 
 We share his determination to improve them. 
 But we recognize that fare wars begun by non-union airline competitors have been responsible for a large part of our difficulties. 
 Mr. Ferris and Jim Hartigan, president of United, are taking steps to improve its earnings. 
 First-quarter financial results of the airline should show a substantial improvement over comparable 1986 results, raising the prospect of a much better year-over-year financial performance in 1987. 


 Contrary to the implication in your article, the fact that the outside directors have employed independent legal and financial counsel in response to the pilots' proposal to purchase United does not bespeak a lack of confidence in Mr. Ferris. 
 The employment of independent counsel by outside directors is standard procedure in proposed corporate buyout situations. 


 The Journal's reference to Donald Trump's reputed desire to cause the breakup of UAL so that he can own the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles ignores an important fact: UAL does not own the Century Plaza. 


 Most unfair and inaccurate was the Journal's reference to the case of the "570 newly hired pilots" whom United "tried to fire" because they "refused to cross picket lines." 
 These are pilots who in 1985 were offered and accepted pre-hiring training with the knowledge they would be expected to fly if United's service were to be disrupted by a strike later that year. 


 When the pilots' strike occurred, the trainees declined to cross the picket line; thus, United declined to hire them. 
 In litigation that arose out of the strike, a federal district court ruled that the 570 individuals must be hired by United, and they have been flying in United cockpits ever since. 


 Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a circuit court reversal of the district court, and held that United was not required to hire the 570 pilots. 
 However, in an effort to let bygones be bygones, United management declined to take advantage of its court victory, and it retained the 570 pilots with seniority dating from 1985 when they actually began flying for United. 


 Neither Mr. Ferris nor the board of directors has any desire to "break" the pilots' union. 
 If harsh things were said by either side in the heat of the 1985 pilot strike, or since, we regret them, and want to forget them. 
 We like and admire our pilots, who are the best in the business, and we respect their right to have a strong union. 
 We are sure that, likewise, they want us to do our best to keep United a strong and prosperous employer.

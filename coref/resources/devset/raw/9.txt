 WASHINGTON  


 Treasury Secretary James Baker held a 7 1/2-hour negotiating session with top Canadian officials, and the two sides made progress toward possible resumption of talks on a free-trade pact. 


 "We have been reviewing all elements of the trade agreement, and we made a lot of progress today," Canadian Trade Minister Pat Carney told reporters. 
 But she said a decision by Canada on whether to resume the negotiations wouldn't come until after Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his cabinet have been briefed today. 


 Mr. Baker and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a statement that the daylong meeting was "a thorough discussion of all the elements involved in the negotiations." 
 They added, "We are hopeful that this will provide a basis for the negotiations to resume, and the U.S. remains prepared to resume negotiations at any time." 


 Canada walked out of the talks last week, claiming that the U.S. had shown insufficient flexibility on Ottawa's main demand for a binding mechanism for settling trade disputes between the two countries.

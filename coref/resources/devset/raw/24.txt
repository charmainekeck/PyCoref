 NEW YORK  


 Gitano Group Inc. President Haim Dabah likes to think of his company as "the Liz Claiborne of the masses." 


 While Liz Claiborne Inc. and other high-fashion womenswear makers sell their clothes through department stores and pricey boutiques, Gitano's market is distinctly middle American. 
 Its outlets are mass merchandisers and discount chains such as K mart Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 


 But like its more glamorous competitors, Gitano puts heavy emphasis on advertising and promotion to create a fashion image for its clothes. 
 In fact, company focus groups indicate Gitano customers associate the brand with fashionable department stores like Bloomingdale's and Neiman-Marcus even though it's primarily sold through mass merchandisers. 


 That perception has been credited to Mr. Dabah, who "has a great flair for marketing and presentation," says Stanley Greenstein, Gitano chief financial officer. 


 Gitano's marketing strategy seems to be paying off. 
 While much of the apparel industry is in the doldrums, Gitano is posting big increases in revenue and earnings. 
 Monday, the company said third-quarter earnings jumped 62.2% to $4.1 million on sales of $119.1 million. 


 Its stock, which was priced at $20.50 a share when the company went public on Sept. 30, dropped a total of $2 on Monday and Tuesday. 
 But analysts didn't see any significance in the drop, since it's a relatively new issue and it's thinly traded -- Mr. Dabah and his family still control 78% of the company. 
 Yesterday the stock gained 12.5 cents to close at $15.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 


 Norman G. Fosback, editor of New Issues, an investment newsletter, notes that investors, familiar with the up-and-down cycles on Seventh Avenue, may be skeptical as to whether Gitano can fly any higher. 
 "One wonders how long can they go on like this," he says. 


 Wal-Mart, of Bentonville, Ark., says that in the two years it has carried the brand, Gitano has grown to become one of its top apparel resources, selling "better than others in the same price range." 
 WalMart attributes Gitano's success to its high-profile marketing techniques and close monitoring of sales trends. 


 Mr. Dabah "firmly believes that after you sell to the retailer, it's just the beginning," Mr. Greenstein says. 


 For example, discount stores are strictly self-service, so Gitano attaches big, colored tags on clothes to show customers how they can fashionably pair tops and bottoms, a tactic that also induces multiple sales. 


 Mr. Dabah, a vivacious salesman, compares himself to "a baseball player coming to work." 
 He relishes cooking up new marketing strategies, listing such projects as mail-in rebates and gift certificates with a purchase. 
 In the past three years, the company also held a nationwide "Gitano Girl" model-search contest. 
 At Bradlees stores, Gitano recently sponsored a sales contest for department managers with prizes like trips to Club Med and color televisions. 
 The result: sales of Gitano clothes were up 180% at Bradlees in one month. 


 As part of his hectic day, Mr. Dabah touches base with his brothers, Isaac, the company's vice chairman, who oversees Gitano's production at its factories in 31 countries, and Ezra, president of Gitano's children's wear division. 


 Mr. Dabah, whose father Morris -- chairman of the company -- founded Gitano 17 years ago after emigrating from Israel, says a major reason the company sells through mass merchandisers is because it's easier to keep costs down. 
 Gitano's staple products -- tops and bottoms for women that sell for around $20 -- don't have "major fashion risks," he says. 
 That means Gitano can commit to styles months ahead of when they're needed and keep its factory contractors operating in slack periods. 


 Gitano also has the luxury of always shipping its goods by sea instead of air. 
 Any sudden fashion shift won't reach the mass market until a season or two later, anyway. 
 The cost savings can be passed on to Gitano's retailers, allowing the company, for example, to keep the wholesale price of its jeans at $10 when "Lee is at $15.75 to $16.50," Mr. Dabah says. 


 The company works to keep its costs down in other areas, too. 
 Two years ago, Mr. Dabah shifted the responsibility for the company's extensive print and television advertising to an in-house staff, enabling Gitano to get more mileage from its annual $15 million advertising budget. 


 Gitano has pulled off a clever illusion with its advertising. 
 The campaign gives its clothes a youthful and trendy image to lure consumers into the store. 
 But most of the clothes are actually cut to fit more mature bodies. 
 Most of Gitano's fans are aging baby boomers, and some of the brand's top sellers are maternity clothes and jeans for larger-sized women. 


 Mr. Dabah's expansion plans include opening more Gitano retail outlets; there are currently 35. 
 Capitalizing on Gitano's fashion image, the company also is rolling out a more expensive brand. 
 Linea Gitano, a new sportswear collection priced from $35 to $70, recently began selling exclusively in department and specialty stores. 


 But Mr. Dabah says his major focus will continue to be the mass market. 
 One area of expansion will be licensing agreements with other apparel companies. 
 This year, for example, Playtex Apparel Inc. licensed the Gitano label for a line of fashion bras in the $6 to $8 range to complement Playtex's basic $15 bras. 
 "The sales have been tremendous so far," says Paul Mischinski, marketing director of Playtex's Gitano brand. 
 Says Mr. Mischinski: "Gitano has the total package-customer awareness, distribution and fashion leadership."

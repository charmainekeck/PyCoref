 Communications Satellite Corp., Washington, said it submitted to the Federal Communications Commission a proposal to reduce by 50% rates for certain international telecommunication services. 


 In exchange for the reductions, customers such as American Telephone & Telegraph Co. would have to commit themselves to using one of two new types of digital satellite services for a 10-year period, Comsat said. 


 The proposal is part of a multi-year agreement between Comsat and AT&T that guarantees Comsat a portion of the telephone company's international business in the face of growing competition from fiber-optic cables. 


 Comsat said AT&T and other customers would be able to convert gradually to the new digital service beginning next year, and that by 1994, as much as 83% of a customer's international circuits could qualify for the price reductions. 


 Digital service allows telecommunications customers to subdivide satellite circuits to handle more than one message at a time, Comsat said.

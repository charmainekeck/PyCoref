 Nynex Corp. and its unions haven't held negotiations this week and haven't scheduled any further talks on a new contract to end a seven-week strike. 


 A company spokesman said that talks with the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers broke down last weekend. 
 Since then, neither side has taken steps to resume discussions. 
 Union spokesmen have said that talks are stalled over a company plan to shift some health-care costs to employees. 


 The CWA represents about 40,000 Nynex employees while the IBEW represents 20,000. 


 In California, meanwhile, CWA members must vote by today on a tentative agreement between union and Pacific Telesis negotiators reached last month. 
 Officials at some union locals are recommending against the proposed contract, raising the possibility that Pac Tel and the union will have to renegotiate parts of the agreement.

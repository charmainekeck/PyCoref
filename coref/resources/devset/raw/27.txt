 NEW YORK  


 A six-month confrontation between Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and a technicians union appears to be ending, in plenty of time for the fall season. 


 ABC said more than 2,000 out of about 2,150 employees belonging to the union have ratified a new four-year contract. 
 A few small work units rejected the contract, ABC said, but are expected to be persuaded to approve it soon. 
 A union press release said the union will schedule further negotiations "as soon as possible" for the units that rejected the offer. 


 The National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians represents mostly engineers, camera operators and tape editors at the network. 
 ABC applauded the new contract, which gives the network more flexibility in such areas as hiring temporary crews. 
 Two years ago, the union and NBC fought over work rules, which led to a 17-week strike.

 Boeing Co. to Pay

 Boeing Co. said it agreed to pay $200,000 to settle seven civil cases brought by the Federal Aviation Administration in connection with the miswiring of fire-protection systems on its jetliners. 


 The fine is the biggest ever collected from Boeing and perhaps from any airplane maker. 


 In July, the FAA proposed a $200,000 penalty in one of the cases in which Boeing allegedly notified the agency months after it uncovered wiring problems on two aircraft. 
 Federal regulations require that defects be reported within 24 hours of their discovery. 


 But the FAA and Boeing worked out a deal in which six other cases related to miswiring were included as part of a comprehensive settlement. 


 The FAA said the agreement specifies a number of corrective actions and design changes to be made by Boeing "to ensure the miswiring conditions that are the subject of these cases will not be repeated." 
 The fire-extinguishing systems have never failed in service. 


 In addition, the FAA said, Boeing has agreed to implement written procedures "to ensure appropriate and timely reporting of all defects" that could hurt safety.

 Sony is thinking small in a big way about video. 


 A decade after its Betamax home-video format lost out to rival VHS, Sony Corp. of America, a unit of the Japanese consumer-electronics giant, is trying to force its way back into the video limelight with its 8mm format, launched four years ago. 
 Sony hopes to popularize "Video 8" through the concept of "personal video" -- video wherever you go -- as exemplified by its Video Walkman line: tiny battery-operated color mini-TVs with built-in videocassette recorders. 


 Sony Corp. has heavily promoted the Video Walkman since the product's introduction last summer, but Bob Gerson, video editor of This Week in Consumer Electronics, says Sony conceives of 8mm as a "family of products, camcorders and VCR decks," whose sales will reinforce one another. 
 He dismisses the Video Walkman as an attention-getting gimmick aimed mainly at well-heeled trend setters: "At $1,000 a pop, you don't sell many of these things." 
 However, he adds, "It's no secret that Sony is looking at 8mm as an all-purpose format." 


 More important to the future of 8mm is Sony's success in the $2.3 billion camcorder market. 
 The Japanese company already has 12% of the total camcorder market, ranking it third behind the RCA and Panasonic brands. 


 But 8mm video faces problems and tough competition. 
 For instance, the rival VHS format has "really got its hooks into the American consumer," says Thomas Chesser, an electronics analyst at Smith Barney. 
 And, 8mm cassettes can't be played on existing VHS equipment. 
 In addition, there's a relative lack of film titles available in 8mm. 


 The great advantage of 8mm is size. 
 Over the past four years, 8mm video camcorders have been a big success among home-video buffs and techno-junkies, who have bought more than one million of the compact units that record and play videos on tapes the size of audiocassettes. 
 That compares with roughly paperback-book dimensions for VHS. 


 Accordingly, most VHS camcorders are usually bulky and weigh around eight pounds or more. 
 In contrast, Sony this month will introduce a full-featured, $1,500 palm-sized 8mm model, the CCD-TR5 Handycam, tipping the scales at less than two pounds. 


 But 8mm is not automatically the walk-away winner in the compact-camcorder sweepstakes. 
 To compete with Video 8, Matsushita Electric Co.'s 51%-owned JVC unit introduced in 1986 a compact version of its dominant VHS format, called VHS-C, that is nearly as small as an 8mm videocassette. 
 And VHS-C can be played on existing VHS machines with only a simple adapter; by contrast, 8mm tapes are incompatible with the VHS machines. 


 At present, VHS-C machines can record for only 20 or 30 minutes, while 8mm tapes run as long as two hours. 
 JVC says it is developing a 40-minute VHS-C cassette and that an enhanced Super VHS version of VHC-C (or S-VHS-C) due this fall would be long enough to show a feature film in the extended-play mode with little detectable picture deterioration. 


 This summer, JVC launched an ad campaign emphasizing the VHS-C's compatibility advantage over 8mm, while its sister company, Panasonic, recently cut list prices $100 to $200 on some of its VHS-C models, to as low as $799. 
 List prices on Sony's camcorders begin at $1,300. 


 Another problem for Sony is that while nearly every movie title is available on VHS cassettes, there are currently only about 1,400 titles on 8mm video. 
 Of those, roughly 250 are feature films; the rest are video magazines, instructional films and documentaries. 
 At present, Sony itself is the primary distributor of prerecorded 8mm tapes through its mail-order Cinema 8 movie club. 


 Bill Fisher, national software-marketing manager with Sony Video Products Co., says the company is adding three titles a month through licensing agreements with the home-video units of Paramount Communications Inc., Nelson Entertainment Co. and Warner Communications Inc. 
 For its part, the unit of what will soon be Time Warner Inc., entered the market last fall with 33 older catalog titles, and this year will release 20 new 8mm titles. 
 And other companies, such as MGM/UA Communications Co. and RCA/Columbia have agreed to license some older titles to Sony. 


 Some studios remain hesitant to enter the market because there isn't a critical mass of 8mm machines in consumers' homes. 
 "It's the proverbial chicken and egg situation," says George Krieger, president and chief executive officer of CBS/Fox Home Video, a leading videocassette distributor that is a joint venture of CBS Inc. and News Corp.'s 20th Century Fox studio, which isn't supplying any 8mm tapes at present. 
 Likewise, MCA Inc.'s home-video unit, which distributes movies made by Universal Studios, says it's looking at the business but isn't in it yet. 


 And video retailers are entering the market warily. 
 Tower Records, a 50-store audio and video retail chain based in Sacramento, Calif., has been "testing" 8mm software sales since April in 12 of its leading stores. 
 John Thrasher, Tower's top video buyer, says he is "really pleased" with most of the test locations, but hastens to add: "I don't know how big of an investment that we as a retailer can invest in {another} video format." 
 In any case, he says he intends to keep at least "a representation of some really hot titles" in 8mm. 


 Minneapolis-based Musicland Group announced last Friday that it will begin test marketing of prerecorded 8mm cassettes at 19 of its 745 audio and video outlets this month. 
 RKO-Warner Video Inc., a 31-store New York-area chain, is also dipping its toe into the 8mm pool this month. 
 "We want to be there if there is a business in 8mm," says Jeff Levy, RKO-Warner vice president, for purchasing. 


 Despite the heat of competition, Mr. Gerson of This Week in Consumer Electronics thinks Sony can succeed in the home-video market in the same way it has thrived in the highly competitive color-television-set market. 
 "Sony only has 8% of the market," he explains, "but they have 20% of the {high-end} market they want, and that's not bad."

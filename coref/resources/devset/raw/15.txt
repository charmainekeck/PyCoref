 ST. PAUL, Minn.  


 The Northwest Airlines flight attendants union said new wage and work rules the NWA Inc. unit has proposed are "unacceptable," and renewed a strike threat. 


 Seeking to end a yearlong stalemate with the union, as previously reported, Northwest said Wednesday it plans unilaterally to impose new contract terms on the attendants April 1. 
 Union leaders complained Northwest is trying to "force a strike" and issued a statement advising passengers with reservations on Northwest over the Easter holidays to "make other arrangements." 


 The union, a Teamsters chapter, invited leaders of the unions representing Northwest pilots and machinists to a strategy meeting Monday in Washington. 
 The Teamsters have yet to win guarantees that the other unions would participate in a walkout. 
 An Air Line Pilots Association spokesman said union leaders haven't decided whether to attend the meeting. 
 A spokesman for the machinists, Northwest's largest union, couldn't be reached for comment. 


 A Northwest spokesman said management is "disappointed" by the union's threat to disrupt holiday service. 
 "We had hoped that if they didn't like the imposed (contract) policy, they would come back to bargaining table and get something better for themselves," he said. 
 The attendants union also called on the company's board to replace Chairman Steven G. Rothmeier with "competent management."

 The National Mediation Board is expected to release Pan Am Corp. and its Teamsters union from their long-stalled contract negotiations, throwing into question a wage-concession agreement. 


 The release means both sides will be asked to submit to arbitration; if one of the parties refuses, as is expected, a 30-day cooling off period will go into effect, after which the Teamsters are free to strike. 


 William Genoese, head of the airline division of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said he was "shocked and surprised" when he heard late Friday from negotiator Walter Wallace of the board's plans to release the parties from negotiations. 


 At noon EST today, the mediation board is expected to ask both parties to submit to arbitration. 


 As previously reported, Pan Am had asked the National Mediation Board to declare an impasse in the talks in late December. 
 But Pan Am, sensing progress in its recent negotiations with the unions, asked the board to delay acting on the company's request, a source close to the board said. 


 Also as previously reported, Pan Am said last week it would make "changes in senior management" in exchange for labor-cost concessions of $180 million a year for three years from the unions of its Pan American World Airways unit. 
 The agreement was reached by a coalition of four of Pan Am's five unions; the Teamsters union was part of that coalition -- but has made it clear recently it did not necessarily go along with the agreement. 


 For the past year, the coalition has been trying to force a restructuring of Pan Am and a change in top management. 
 Negotiations have been held with William T. Coleman, a Pan Am director and Washington attorney. 


 Pan Am's directors are scheduled to meet tomorrow, the deadline set for the union's wage-concession agreement. 
 It wasn't immediately clear if the Teamsters's release might jeopardize that agreement. 


 Last Saturday, Mr. Genoese said he sent a telegram to Mr. Coleman to announce that the Teamsters plan to end their talks with the company. 
 Mr. Genoese said he had a "cordial" initial meeting with Mr. Coleman last Thursday, but made no commitment to provide concessions. 


 "That meeting made it clear to Mr. Coleman that the Teamsters and Pan Am are still deadlocked," one source close to the negotiations said. 


 "As far as we're concerned, the company triggered this," Mr. Genoese said. 
 "We're not negotiating any more with Pan Am. 
 We're in strike procedure now." 
 The union has already indicated it would not be willing to submit to arbitration. 


 A Pan Am spokesman declined to comment. 


 The Teamsters, which represent about 4,500 ticket agents, reservation agents and clerical workers, have been working under a contract that was negotiated in 1978 and scheduled to be renegotiated in 1981. 
 The federal mediation board has rejected several earlier requests by the union to declare the negotiations deadlocked. 


 Meanwhile, Pan Am's pilots union said it is preparing to sign an agreement to deliver concessions to the company today. 
 A pilot's union spokesman said the leaders plan to take the agreement to their membership for ratification. 
 He said he didn't know how the Teamsters action would affect the union's agreement with the company.

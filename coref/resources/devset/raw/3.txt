More of USAir in Additional Blow to Bid

 A federal judge in Pittsburgh issued a temporary restraining order preventing Trans World Airlines from buying additional shares of USAir Group Inc. 


 The order, requested in a suit filed by USAir, dealt another blow to TWA's bid to buy the company for $52 a share. 


 Washington-based USAir, which reached an agreement Friday to acquire Piedmont Aviation Inc., yesterday began a $69 a share tender offer for all the stock outstanding of Winston-Salem, N.C.,-based Piedmont. 
 The proposed transaction has an indicated value of $1.59 billion. 


 Carl C. Icahn, chairman of TWA, wouldn't say whether TWA would continue its attempt to take over USAir. 
 Mr. Icahn disclosed last week that TWA already had become USAir's largest shareholder, with a 15% stake as of Friday. 


 Some Wall Street sources and airline industry analysts said they doubted that Mr. Icahn would press the attempt if USAir buys Piedmont. 
 "I don't think (TWA) has the wherewithal" to buy USAir and Piedmont combined, said Louis Marckesano, a securities analyst at Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. Mr. Marckesano said TWA and Mr. Icahn would need an estimated $3.5 billion to acquire USAir once the merger with Piedmont is completed. 


 But TWA, as expected, yesterday filed a second application with the Department of Transportation for permission to acquire USAir. 
 The department last week rejected TWA's first application as "deficient" because it omitted such important information as the merger's potential impact on competition and pricing. 
 "It's a serious application," a department official said of the new filing. 


 Even so, Wall Street and airline industry sources have continued to view TWA's bid for USAir skeptically, seeing it as a ploy to pressure USAir into buying TWA. 


 That view was supported in a tender-offer document filed by USAir with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in another document filed in court. 
 The filings gave details of conversations between Mr. Icahn and Edwin I. Colodny, chairman and chief executive officer of USAir. 
 USAir said in the filings that Mr. Icahn first contacted Mr. Colodny last September to discuss the benefits of combining TWA and USAir -- either by TWA's acquisition of USAir, or USAir's acquisition of TWA. 


 On Feb. 21, after the USAir bid for Piedmont, Mr. Icahn again called Mr. Colodny, according to the documents. 
 Mr. Icahn, the documents said, told Mr. Colodny that a merger between Piedmont and USAir would put TWA in a tough competitive position. 
 Mr. Icahn reportedly said he "couldn't watch that happen." 
 Mr. Icahn then proposed that USAir buy TWA, or that TWA buy USAir. 


 While Mr. Icahn is known to have approached several investment bankers in the last week, seeking advice on how to proceed with TWA's offer for USAir, Wall Street sources say he hasn't retained any investment banking firm in connection with the bid. 


 Nevertheless, sources close to USAir and Piedmont weren't willing to claim victory over Mr. Icahn and TWA, even though the tender offer for Piedmont has begun. 
 "Carl is a tenacious fellow," said a source close to USAir. 
 "He doesn't give up easily and one should never underestimate what he can or will do." 
 Mr. Icahn couldn't be reached for comment. 


 Sources familiar with Mr. Icahn and TWA said that, so far, the airline is taking a loss on USAir shares it bought late last week. 
 TWA is understood to have held a 4.9% stake in USAir for nearly a year before increasing its position to 15% in recent weeks. 
 A source close to Mr. Icahn said that the latest stake was bought at prices ranging from about $48.50 a share to more than $50 a share. 
 That would indicate that TWA has taken a loss of more than $5 million on its USAir shares. 


 TWA stock closed at $28, down $2.50 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday. 
 The drop reduced the market value of the 22 million shares that Mr. Icahn and an Icahn-led investor group hold in TWA by some $55 million. 
 USAir stock fell $3.375 to close at $47.75, and Piedmont declined 62.5 cents to $67.625. 


 Wall Street traders said Piedmont shares fell partly because of market uncertainty about federal regulatory approval for a merger with USAir. 
 But sources close to USAir said they didn't believe there would be any problem obtaining approval for the merger and pointed out that the company plans to complete its tender  Paragraphing Error  

Sources close to USAir and Piedmont conceded that if TWA
is permitted to buy more USAir shares, it certainly has
enough cash, an estimated $900 million, to do so. Of that
money, about $150 million is committed to the purchase of USX
Corp. shares, in which Mr. Icahn currently owns an 11.4%
stake.

 TWA hasn't yet filed documents with the SEC in connection with its USAir holding, and it isn't known how much of TWA's money is committed to buying USAir shares. 


 Separately, in its SEC filing, USAir disclosed details of its plans for financing the Piedmont acquisition. 
 The company said it received a letter from New York-based Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Friday indicating the bank's willingness to provide as much as $500 million for the purchase. 
 USAir said Manufacturers Hanover also is willing to act as agent to raise the remainder of the funds. 


 USAir said it expects to borrow as much as $2 billion from banks to complete the acquisition. 
 It then plans to refinance the bank loans with proceeds from public or private equity and subordinated debt offerings. 


 The airline also said in the filing that it expects to keep Piedmont's headquarters in Winston-Salem. 
 USAir said that William R. Howard, chairman and chief executive of Piedmont, will be elected president of USAir after the merger is completed. 


 Lawyers for TWA and USAir are due back in court in Pittsburgh this morning to determine whether TWA can proceed to buy more USAir stock. 
 USAir has asked the court to issue a preliminary injunction, enjoining TWA from buying more USAir shares and from interfering with USAir's tender offer for Piedmont stock. 


 USAir argues that Mr. Icahn and TWA violated the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act by buying more than $15 million of USAir stock without first receiving regulatory approvals. 
 USAir also alleges that Mr. Icahn and TWA weren't entitled to buy more than 10% of USAir's stock without first receiving permission from the Transportation Department. 


 A lawyer for TWA and Mr. Icahn, in an affidavit, denied that TWA has done anything wrong by buying a 15% stake in USAir. 
 TWA says that it isn't subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino regulations and must only seek approval from the Transportation Department. 


 Lawyers for TWA said that the voting-trust application they filed with the department Wednesday allows the airline to buy USAir stock while a separate application to acquire control of USAir is considered. 
 Indeed, TWA contends that Houston-based Texas Air Corp. bought more than 9.9% of Eastern Airlines -- which it later acquired entirely -- before the department approved Texas Air's application to create a trust to hold the shares.

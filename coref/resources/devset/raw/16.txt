 Chrysler Corp. this year will take the highly unusual step of setting up a formal grievance procedure for its non-union white-collar employees. 


 "We understand that (Chrysler's) dramatic restructuring . . . will inevitably lead many employees to question management's decisions and actions," Anthony P. St. John, vice president for human resources of the auto maker's Chrysler Motors subsidiary, said in a speech at Oakland University here yesterday. 
 "Employees may not feel that they are being treated fairly." 


 To "strengthen management's credibility," Mr. St. John added, the company will set up an "alternative disputes resolution" system similar to a traditional union grievance procedure. 


 "For the first time these employees will be guaranteed a formal and impartial internal mechanism to resolve discipline, discharge, and employment opportunity disputes," Mr. St. John said. 


 The process will have several steps, concluding with final arbitration handled by a neutral third party. 


 Chrysler's move apparently was inspired by the turmoil created by its current cost-cutting and restructuring, forces which are transforming many industrial companies. 
 The auto maker is significantly changing wage and benefit plans, and is trying to slash its white-collar rolls, particularly in the wake of its acquisition last year of American Motors Corp. 


 Chrysler has about 31,000 white-collar employees in the U.S., up sharply from roughly 21,000 in 1982. 
 About 6,000 salaried workers are currently represented by the United Auto Workers union. 
 Some analysts speculated the move is designed to stave off further union organizing in the white-collar ranks. 


 Several management consultants said a formal grievance procedure with third-party arbitration was common for government employees, but they had never heard of such a policy for non-union employees at a major private company. 


 "It has the potential of undermining supervisory and management responsibility and authority," said Jerrold Bratkovich, a vice president in the Los Angeles office of the Hay Group, a management consulting firm. 
 "That's one of the main reasons employers don't want to have unionization." 


 A Chrysler spokesman said the company had studied "a couple" of other companies that had arbitration for nonunion employees, but he couldn't recall which companies. 


 A more common business approach is the "open-door" policy such as that at International Business Machines Corp., where "any employee who has a problem which has not been resolved to satisfaction . . . can bring the complaint to the attention of higher management," said an IBM spokesman. 


 "If the employee is still not satisfied, the problem can be reviewed with the IBM chief executive officer," the spokesman added. 


 Chrysler will implement its system later this year. 
 The details haven't yet been worked out, Chrysler said. 


 According to a slide used in Mr. St. John's presentation, the policy would cover all "professional, administrative, management and executive employees." 
 It would also have a four-step grievance process, just as UAW-represented workers have.

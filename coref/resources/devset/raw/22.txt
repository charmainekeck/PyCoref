 Massachusetts, in a move that may be repeated in a number of states, will eliminate mandatory arbitration in disputes between brokers and investors. 


 A new regulation, scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, will require brokers to advise customers of their constitutional right to take disputes to court. 
 And brokers can't refuse to do business with an investor who declines to sign a statement agreeing to settle disputes through arbitration. 


 The securities industry has favored arbitration because it keeps brokers and dealers out of court. 
 But consumer advocates say customers sometimes unwittingly sign away their right to sue. 


 "We don't necessarily have a beef with the arbitration process," says Martin Meehan, deputy secretary of state in Massachusetts. 
 "We just think the consumers ought to have a choice." 


 Massachusetts is the first of what may be several states to bar mandatory arbitration. 
 According to a survey by the North American Securities Administrators Association, which comprises securities regulators in the 50 states, a dozen or more states in the next six months expect to consider rules banning forced arbitration. 


 The securities administrators have a laundry list of complaints against mandatory arbitration. 
 "The panels (of arbitrators) are stacked in favor of the industry, the proceedings are not public and there are no written decisions," says Scott Stapf, director of consumer education for the administrators' association. 


 Mandatory arbitration agreements have proliferated since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 1987 that brokers could require that their customers sign them. 
 The most common agreements require customers who believe their brokers have defrauded them to submit to arbitration instead of filing a lawsuit. 
 Because of rules requiring abbreviated evidence and arguments, arbitration is generally faster than going to court. 
 And the losing side has no route for appeal -- the arbitrator's decision is final. 


 The popularity of the agreements among brokers was cemented after the October market crash. 
 As a result of previously signed agreements, hundreds of investors were forced to file arbitration claims, and brokers avoided time-consuming and expensive lawsuits. 
 But the securities administrators' association said most of the 15,000 calls to its post-crash hotline were complaints about forced arbitration. 


 Mandatory arbitration agreements are most commonly required of customers buying on margin or dealing in options. 
 But the state securities regulators want to make sure that the practice doesn't spread to the smaller, less risky cash customers, hence the Massachusetts regulation. 


 The Securities Industry Association, whose representatives testified against the Massachusetts regulation during public hearings in July, already is prepared to challenge the regulation in court. 


 "What they're doing is clearly unconstitutional," says Bill Fitzpatrick, general counsel for the SIA. 
 "There will be a legal challenge." 
 Mr. Fitzpatrick says the Supreme Court ruled in June 1987 that states are pre-empted from taking any action against arbitration in securities cases. 


 James C. Meyer, president of the North American Securities Administrators Association, disagrees. 
 The Supreme Court ruling, he says, said only that brokers can require customers to sign arbitration agreements. 
 "It doesn't say arbitration agreements are OK and everyone should sign on," Mr. Meyer says.

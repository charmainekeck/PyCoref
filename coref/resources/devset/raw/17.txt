 President Reagan acknowledged that there is little chance he and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will sign a strategic arms agreement at their summit in Moscow later this month. 


 In answering questions from members of the National Strategy Forum here, Mr. Reagan said it is "doubtful" that a strategic arms reduction, or START, treaty could be wrapped up in time. 
 Administration aides have been saying for weeks that there are far too many disagreements remaining for a treaty to be wrapped up, but Mr. Reagan's remarks represented his bluntest public assessment so far. 


 Mr. Reagan said that both he and Mr. Gorbachev hope that an agreement eliminating intermediate-range nuclear missiles, signed at a summit meeting in Washington last December, will be ratified by the Senate in time for the Moscow summit. 
 But then he added: "Our desire that we would be able to sign a START treaty at this Moscow summit, as we did the other one at the Washington summit, may not happen." 


 Mr. Reagan insisted that if such a treaty is ever completed, it would have to produce "parity" in U.S. and Soviet strategic arsenals.

 VANCOUVER, British Columbia  


 A group of large British Columbia forest products companies has reached a tentative, three-year labor contract with about 18,000 members of the IWA-Canada union, a spokesman for the companies said. 


 The settlement involves about 80 companies, including Vancouver-based MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. and other large integrated forest products concerns with operations on the coast of British Columbia. 
 The companies negotiate jointly through a bargaining agent called Forest Industrial Relations Ltd. 


 A spokesman for the bargaining agent said the settlement is retroactive to June 15 and provides for a pay increase of 85 Canadian cents (70.2 US cents) in the first year and 5.5% in each of the second and third years, on a base rate of about 14.80 Canadian dollars (US$12.23) an hour. 


 The pay terms are similar to those accepted recently by members of two pulp and paper unions in British Columbia, the spokesman said. 
 The IWA-Canada settlement involves workers in sawmills, logging operations and wood manufacturing, and the contract remains subject to ratification by the union members. 


 The union is still negotiating with two smaller regional employer bargaining groups in the interior of British Columbia. 
 The continuing negotiations affect about 8,000 to 10,000 union members.
